If you haven't covered Tactics 101, you should probably go do that [here](/articles/tactics-101).

This is where things stop being as abstract. In the previous class, I talked about the basics of offense, defense, proactivity, and reactivity. I glossed over opsec and infosec, I quoted Sun Tzu and referenced Machiavelli.

Today, we're going to talk about something different and start getting a little _concrete._\
See, today, I'm starting with consequences and counterplay.

"Consequence" is a real loaded term, so let's define it: a simple effect of your actions or lack thereof. Let's say I slap you. For the sake of argument, it is nonconsensual and unprovoked.\
The first consequence of this is that you are physically hurt, considering I've got a fairly good arm. The second consequence of this is likely that you feel emotionally hurt. The consequence of those consequences is that you, if you have self-respect, are going to take actions to counterplay me here.

Let's define "counterplay": in context, it is any action taken _in consequence._ In the same scenario, where I slapped you, being unwilling to be around me is consequence, and telling your friends I slapped you is counterplay. Good counterplay is going to prevent yourself and others from getting slapped by me again.

The line counterplay walks, though, is _retaliation._\
Be very, very fucking careful with it.\
The delineation is not one I can describe. You've kind of got to hone an intuition on it, the best heuristic I can give is along the lines of "if I acted this way to someone, and they responded the way I want to, would that be justified?" I've been on both sides of retaliation, and it sucks, actually. 

Getting good at tactics involves building those intuitive models up. Everyone and their mother recommends chess, it's the classic strategy game, but truth is I've never really liked chess, especially as a good tacsim. Hidden information is an essential thing in tactics.

Unfortunately, the best teacher is experience. Low-stakes things are going to be the way you can fail and learn with minimal consequences, but they're never going to teach you what it's like to win or lose with, well, stakes. I've unfortunately had a lot of experience in higher stakes, due to having a hell of a messy life, and I cannot recommend it.

However! I can recommend, if you want to get good at tactics, Magic: the Gathering is a legitimately good way to learn game strategy once you have a handle on the mechanics. It's a high upfront time and sometimes money investment, but it helped. A better option is a good wargame or intrigue game with friends, ideally with a GM who is good at tactics and strategy--earlier D&D/Pathfinder 1e and Lancer are good wargames for tactics and strategy, and while I want to shill my own intrigue game, I believe the best recommendation I've seen on the market is likely going to be Blades in the Dark.

I don't have anything else for you today. Class dismissed!
