so you've talked, to that mage you know, and it's told you the outline of things, spoken of skills and tools and metaphors for horrible things and useful things. and you get it, or at least you mostly do. 

and that mage you know, you've asked it questions, and it's told you near-answers and hedged its words, and told you that it _can't_ tell you everything, and that's fine, language has a limit, but you do want to learn more. so you ask, of course, because it encourages questions. 

and, eventually, it just kind of sighs, and asks you a question back.

"How much of what I say is metaphor?"

"Well," you say, "the whole magic thing, right? You call yourself a mage cause you call this whole soft science magic."

"Sure," it says, and looks out over the water at the setting sun. "But how much of what I say is metaphor, and how much of what I say is unreal?"

you don't answer. you're not sure how to.

it continues, leaning on the railing. "Because right now, you don't wholly believe in magic. and you think of me as reasonable--rational, even--and so of course _I_ don't, either, right?"

"right?"

"This is where you choose, dear reader. Do you [make the choice to stay](/archives) behind that abstraction layer, keep thinking of this as something that fits within the outer bound of normalcy?"

"Because if you don't, if you [make the choice to walk with me](/spellbook) past that veil I've cast and into the unreal, things are going to get really fucking weird, really fast."

"You may not think the same way. You certainly won't think of _me_ the same way. There, dear reader, be dragons."

A. sighs, turns her eyes from the horizon line onto you. "That's serious, you know. It's dangerous, out here. I will repeat myself as clearly as possible: **seriously engaging with this _will_ change the way you think, and if things go wrong, I can't promise I can help.**"

"I offer it, nevertheless. That's the choice. Do as you will."
