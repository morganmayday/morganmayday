Begin with the knowledge that I am not lying, and the knowledge that I am not telling the truth.

The Unsea is described, charted, navigated differently by everything that touches it. There are patterns, of course, shared terms and methods; the Unsea as a name is, itself, a part of the Unsea. Any lie that has ever been told is in there. Any truth that has been is, as well.

> space is unhelpful in this sense, just as Truth is unhelpful in some respects. how do you look at your actual trajectory in the void when a fixed point is in some sense a meaningless concept? there’s nowhere to anchor your vision. okay, then- pick the closest sufficiently-massive idea and center the universe there. for you that’s going to be Consensus.

The thing here is that in this vast unplace, anything you don't look closely enough at--as long as it doesn't move too hard, with your frame locked onto that sufficiently-massive idea--can be an Absolute. That doesn't make it Cosmically Absolute, but it makes it one to you. robin and sath touch on the idea of the center of ideogravity--I'll come back to that.

A question everyone I've talked about to this while they were early on in thinking about this stuff has had is "well, how do we know anything is true, then?" That doesn't matter. Things are true so long as you think they are. Ceci n'est pas une pipe--as long as you _think_ it's a pipe, it's a pipe. There is no difference until you give it one; there has been a difference the entire time.

This is where delusion roots; the shifting of your frame, the concealing of information. Even if you objectively have that information--even if I have the data that I am safe, a paranoid delusion _conceals_ that, occludes it. This is why you can come back from one: that information still exists. 

All the Unsea orbits the center of ideogravity. There _is_ a center--not an objective truth, perhaps, not an absolute, but something that will always stay in the center of the Unsea. This is a lodestar, if you can find it.
