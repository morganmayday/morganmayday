The first thing to understand here is that nothing I'm saying is, exactly, true. That doesn't mean I'm lying.

Take a step back, slide to the left. The first thing to understand here is that nothing I'm saying can be, exactly, true. That doesn't mean it's not real.

Turn your head a bit, narrow your eyes. The first thing to understand here is that there's real and Real. That doesn't mean they're different or the same.

We're real, aren't we? You and I, here and now, we're real things in real space somewhere. Except, we're not, are we? You and I, here and now. This is the world I've evoked, and you've conjured, and neither of those are Real; and for all you know I'm a character, and for all I know nobody's on the other end, here.

You could define Reality as provability. You could define it as tangibility. You could define it however you want, and maybe you'd find something you'd like. I'm not going to do that.

Close your eyes, open them again. The first thing to understand here is that there is the Real World, and that is all there is. Where do you think ideas reside, then? 

You could say, "well, they're recorded, in brain or pencil or another medium," and you'd be technically correct, and that'd be that. If it's not a real place, it must not exist.

Turn around. Look again. If it's not a Real place, it must be an Unreal one.
