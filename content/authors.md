so you want to know who we are. well, we won't tell you that, not outright. make your own judgements.\
but for the sake of simplicity--a little bit, about each of us, and the site. Essays are tagged by primary author. We all work together, most of the time. If you're careful, and you know us well, you might be able to spot the differences.

#### Morgan
Taskmage, advisor, evoker. Art as a guiding star, passion as an engine, will as a scheme. Something to say on the tip of the tongue. Wild surmise.

#### Ley
Seer, lover, judge. Temperance to impulse. Measure twice, cut once. Plans to plots to action; clarity in surety; tension from foresight.

#### Caroline
Technician, planner, artificer. Forward-thinking and past-untangling. Seeking perfect in service of good enough. Staring into the void for data.
