The first version of this guide is being published 05 February 2026, and will be continually updated as I acquire more good recipes. If you have a good, easy recipe, email it to me at [me@morganmay.day](mailto:me@morganmay.day) and I might give it a shot :)

### Why?
[I've detailed my reasons why](/advice/empathy), but you may have your own! I won't waste time speculating.

If you've been struggling to make the whole change at once, I *highly* recommend taking it in steps. Going vegetarian is way easier than going vegan, making it a really good stepping-stone.

### Nutrition
If you're going vegan, you gotta watch a couple things.

-- B12--seaweed contains some, but a supplement is still basically required. I take one 5k mcg sublingual tablet 1-3 times a week and it seems to work.\
-- Protein--protein. You need it. Tofu, beans, oats, nuts, and potatoes are all good towards getting enough protein.

There are other nutrients to keep an eye on--iron, calcium, and omega-3, off the top of my head, but a more detailed search and a knowledge of your own health will serve you better.

### Nonvegan ingredients
With almost anything, you can google whether it's vegan or not--some things even are labeled, but here's my short list I look for when buying food. 

These are always nonvegan:\
-- Dairy, meat, eggs, obviously\
-- Shellac\
-- Gelatin\
-- Whey (is a milk product)\
-- Honey\
-- Lanolin (used in cereals for Vitamin D3 fortification)\
-- Carmine/cochineal/red 4\
-- Lard\
-- Casein\
-- Cysteine

These sometimes show up on package-certified vegan foods:\
-- Non-organic, non-cane sugar is most often processed with bone char (in the US)\
-- Mono-and-diglycerides\
-- Pectin (fruit pectin is fine)\
-- Lactic acid (can be plant-sourced)

### Store-bought ready foods
I fucking hate Whole Foods, but their 365 brand _does_ clearly label their vegan products, and they do generally have a fairly robust alternative foods section. Amy's Vegan Margarita frozen pizza is the best vegan frozen pizza I've ever had. Ben n Jerry's oat-based ice cream is vegan, as far as I've seen. Morningstar Farms has some explicitly-labeled vegan foods--some of their foods are vegetarian instead, keep an eye out, I can personally recommend their corn dogs. I've been recommended the Trader Joes' vegan tikka masala, though I've never tried it.

If you drink, I can say off the top of my head that Jinro soju and Kraken rum are vegan, but Kahlua and Fireball aren't. Check [barnivore](https://www.barnivore.com/) for your drinks of choice.

### Cooking
These recipes assume you have a working stovetop. I haven't used a microwave in over a calendar year, so I don't have any microwave recipes; I'll indicate the oven recipes.

Some quick definitions, keeping in mind I am not very cooking-literate, these are just what I've picked up:\
-- A saucepan is a pot with a stick-out handle, usually also smaller.\
-- A frying pan/skillet is the much flatter version, usually very short but much broader.\
-- Low heat is the 1-2 setting on most stoves, medium-low heat is the 3-4 setting on most stoves, 5-6 is medium, 7-8 is medium-high, and 9-10 is high heat, usually. Stoves do vary, though.\
-- A boil is when big bubbles are coming to the surface of a fluid. If in doubt, it's not boiling.

### Low Effort
These recipes can be done quickly and for very little energy. I generally lean here for breakfasts. Since these are really easy, I'm not including recipes proper.

#### Toast
You know how to make toast. Vegan butters are good, jam is good, and if you want protein, peanut butter helps. Garlic's also fucking fantastic.

#### Bagels
Bagels are really good, and a lot of them are naturally vegan. There are plant-based cream cheese alternatives, but peanut butter, jam, or vegan butter will serve you *excellently,* while I find plant-based cream cheeses vary significantly in quality.

You can also make your own bagels! There are plenty of recipes online for that.

#### PB&J
PB&J is a standby for a reason. If you toast the bread before spreading it, you get some good good crunch.

If you want a more sophisticated PB&J, try frying the bread lightly in some seasoned vegan butter--parsley and oregano, some salt, about a third of a stick of butter over medium-low (3 on most stoves) heat. Flip it over about 4 minutes in, once it's browned on one side, and fry the other for a couple minutes as well. This takes a lot more effort, but it's worth it sometimes.

### Medium Effort
These recipes usually take about 15 minutes with little prep time.

#### Oatmeal
0.5 cup oats, 1 cup water, pinch of salt, and brown sugar/maple syrup to taste\
Requires a saucepan or pot, and a stirring spoon.

1) Salt and boil your water.
2) Add the oats, then reduce to medium low heat.
3) Cook and stir for about 12 minutes.
4) Remove from heat and let stand for about 2 minutes.
5) Stir in unrefined/organic brown sugar to taste before serving. Same with maple syrup, though less is generally more there.

#### Pasta
Box of pasta, dash of salt, and butter/sauce to taste\
Requires a saucepan or pot, and a stirring spoon. A colander helps.

Check your box directions, and follow them. Usually, this is:\
1) Fill your saucepan mostly with water. Drop in a dash (a small amount, usually an overflowing pinch) of salt, and stir lightly for like 10 seconds while you set the heat to high.
2) Once your water is boiling, dump in your pasta and wait about 8-15 minutes, depending on variety. Turn your heat down to medium-high.
3) Make sure the water doesn't boil over--if it does, take it off the heat for a second til it stops rising and goes back down to just a boil. If you have an electric, not gas, stove, you can put a wooden spoon over the top and it'll delay the boil-over slightly, but it is more of a fire hazard on a gas stove.
4) Once your timer is up, drain the pasta. You can do this in a colander, though I just pour out the water using the spoon to stop the pasta from coming past, which takes a bit more finesse but doesn't require a colander.
5) Melt a bit of butter, to taste, in the still-hot saucepan, and stir with the pasta before serving.

### High Effort
Don't get discouraged by the name! These recipes are all worth the time and energy, they just take at least 30min including prep time.

#### Pancakes
1.5 cup flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 0.5 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp granulated sugar, 1 cup alternative milk, 0.5 cup water, up to 2 tbsp canola oil\
Requires a whisk (or spoon but it's worse), stirring spoon, spatula, mixing bowl, large skillet or griddle, and optionally a ladle

1) Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. (You can even bag this mix and use it later.)
2) Pour the milk, water, and oil in, stir until just combined (a few lumps are fine, don't worry about getting it smooth as sharks.)
3) Grease the skillet (cooking spray works, butter likely works too), then heat over medium-high heat.
4) Drop about a third of a cup of batter onto it. Cook until it begins to bubble, then flip it and cook until golden brown, which is about 1-2 minutes usually.
5) Serve hot, or freeze and eat through the week. 

#### "Fries"
A good-sized russet potato (or two or three smaller ones), about 0.5 to 2/3 cup olive oil (extra virgin recommended), black pepper, onion powder, salt, garlic powder (or a little garlic oil substituted for some of the olive oil)\
Requires a cutting board, kitchen knife, saucepan, and spoon or spatula. A potato peeler is optional, but can make your life way easier. I recommend having somewhere to put the oil as well--don't just pour it down the drain after you're done. An empty glass pasta sauce jar works well.

1) Wash your potatoes thoroughly, then peel them. If there's a bit that looks bad on the potato, just cut it out.
2) Chop your peeled potatoes into bite-sized chunks--a good rule of thumb is square chunks a little shorter than your thumb from tip to first joint.
3) Pour the oil into the saucepan, then season it. Measure with your heart. If you can't do that, do about half a tablespoon of onion powder, about a teaspoon of salt, and about a teaspoon of black pepper. Stir it a bit, and put the oil on low heat.
4) Drop in the potatoes. Be careful of oil splashing. Toss them a bit in the pan to coat all of them in the oil.
5) Cook your potatoes, stirring continuously, for about 15 minutes on low heat until they've started to soften (you can check by poking them, if they split a little when you stab em lightly with a knife like you're trying to pick them up, you've cooked them enough.)
6) Fry your potatoes for a couple minutes (3-5ish), turning up the heat to medium-low.
7) Serve hot, fresh, and with ketchup.

#### Garlic bread
Bread (either sliced sourdough, or a baguette/loaf cut in half), 0.5 cup unsalted vegan butter, as much garlic as your heart desires (I recommend like a normal-sized bulb, or substitute 3 tbsp of garlic powder), 2 tbsp parsley, pinch of black pepper, two pinches of salt\
Requires a baking sheet, oven, bowl of any kind, mixing bowl, and kitchen knife.

1) Set out the butter to soften, and preheat the oven to 375F/190C. (You can soften the butter with light microwaving if you want, you just don't want to melt it.)
2) Peel the garlic, then crush it under the flat of your knife against the counter or cutting board (put all your weight on it til you feel it _crunch_), then chop it up as small as you can get it.
3) Mix and mash the ingredients into a paste in the bowl, then spread it thick on one side of the bread. If you have vegan parmesan, dust it over the paste now.
4) Place bread on baking sheet, paste up, for about 12-15 minutes.
5) Serve hot.
