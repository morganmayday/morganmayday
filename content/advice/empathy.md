"The nature of empathy and sympathy," I don't say, "that I've met very few people who understand, is that they're rarely-to-never going to be exactly right. I don't really think of myself as having sympathy, because sympathy is _understanding_ how others feel—I can guess, and I can guess very, very well; my models are generally _really good_, but I will never be physically inside someone else's head. The mistake of sympathy and empathy is thinking you're always right."

Instead, I check the time, tuck my phone away, and settle down next to you on the park bench in the predawn light.

Empathy is something that has bothered me in one form or another my entire life.

I was an Emotional Little Boy. I cried at movies and for friends. I had to leave the room when a character in a book did something uncomfortable. It was trained and beaten out of me, mostly by the school system. I still remember my third-grade teacher telling me "crying is not the third-grade choice". My mother and father, to their credit, _mostly_ tried to protect me. Depression and puberty hit at the same time for No Reason At All, and then I was having trouble feeling anything at all except that pervasive wish to not be me anymore, to be anywhere but there.

Then I became an Emotional Little [Redacted], and any kindness the world felt towards a young boy who's got a lot of emotions and care in him evaporated. I was taught, over and over again, sometimes by people who had been caring when I'd been a boy, that nobody likes a faggot who cries. I tried my level best not to cry anymore, to be more than that--I shied away from womanhood, because it scared me, and I _had_ to train myself out of empathy, because it had become a liability. Didn't stop me from crying for myself, but it stopped me from crying for others.

Then I was eighteen and half a country away from where I'd grown up and it felt _wonderful._ I was free, finally. My older brother and I lived together, and I never had to worry about being hurt for crying again.

(I did worry about it, still. Almost like post the trauma, it left some kind of disordering stress. Much to think about.)

Now I'm a grown woman, back in the city I grew up in, and I speak to my mother and father again, and I don't cry in front of them.

Empathy is...I have, as you might be able to tell, strong feelings about it.\
It is a force designed to motivate you into compassion. We live in a world where, we're taught, compassion is a liability for people—so the people who act with compassion are the ones who can afford to, or who _have to._ This + the systemic impoverishment of the majority of humanity means a lot of people whose empathy doesn't hit the Breaking Point, the burning _need_ to help that empathy can provoke, won't act, and a not-insignificant fraction of those who _do_ hit that breaking point _can't_ help.

When I say I'm low-no empathy, a lot of liberals look at me sideways. "What do you mean?" they say. "Is this a disordered autistic thing," the especially observant might ask.\
"No," I always say, "I just don't feel empathy because I don't need it. I'm acting with compassion either way—borrowing distress would just make me less effective."\
"Well, at least you have sympathy," they say, and file me as Evil Waiting To Happen, and that's where I tend to smile and nod, because I don't want to get into the weeds.

Everyone who's had this conversation with me in this way loves the Flesh Racket.

I find that a kind of morbidly funny.

The thing is, right, everyone has a limit to their empathy. Most only consider animals in front of them worthy of it—oh, they love puppies cause they're cute, and there might be a desire for animal rights, there might be a dislike of the abhorrent conditions of factory farming, but mmmmm burgers taste good! You might trap spiders and frogs and release them outside, and then turn around and have your wonderful breakfast of eggs and bacon!

Where's the line, for you? When does something stop being a person, something worthy of love and respect and care, and start being the food on your plate? Is it when it stops looking human? Is it when it stops being cute? Is it when it's murdered out of your line of sight, a fact you can ignore and push off and disengage from? Why are they any different? What's the line, where it's okay to kill them for their body?

What you're saying, when you engage by hand or by money in the slaughter and exploitation of other living things for your material gain and consider it something that's remotely OK, is that the Flesh Racket has you by the soul, that you cannot think beyond [Moloch](/glossary#moloch) or [Naraka](/glossary#naraka) or [Mars](/glossary#mars), depending on your excuse, that I'm _one of the good nonpeople,_ that your empathy, sympathy, and compassion end at the border of Personhood and only extend across on vacation.

And I know what you'll say in defense of yourself, honey, a dozen "what abouts" or caveats or "I have tos". I know because I stood where you're standing, and I felt threatened and afraid, and _none of those excuses were good enough._

...sun's coming up, dear. Stay out here with me?
