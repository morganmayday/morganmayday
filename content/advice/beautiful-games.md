The term "beautiful game" is--well, apparently, it's a nickname for association football/soccer. Didn't actually know that one, but it just showed up in preliminary research. Wild.

Where was I? Ah, yeah. The term "beautiful game" is something that might seem...kind of strange out of context, especially if you're used to it in the context of football. It gets more complicated outside of contexts with specific mastery--[zugzwang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang) is beautiful, [hackenbush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush) is beautiful, [Gifts Ungiven in the hands of Frank Karsten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHHZHD0soQ) was beautiful back at Worlds 2005, all of these are fairly indisputable, but what do I _mean?_

The objective of a beautiful game is to make something beautiful. 

Morgan is an _avid_ TTRPG player. Collectively, we have spent thousands upon thousands of hours playing, running, writing, and developing games. So what's a beautiful game, in the context of a TTRPG?

A beautiful game is more than the sum of its parts. It's a conversation, a story being told by the game. I'm not talking something like "we have a plot we're going down", either. It's--improv. Call and response, taking both seriously. A game as _art._

when I play with my colleague morrigan, there's something that happens. We're not--speculating, we're not plotting. I have loose beats plotted, but that doesn't matter. It's a call and response, with mechanics as adjudicator. I'm not the Spinner, the GM, the what-have-you, and morrigan's not the player--we're storytellers together, and that's it.

This isn't just because we _choose_ to do it. I mean, we do choose, agency's a wonderful thing, but we trust each other to play off of that. I think Morgan and mori have asked each other maybe one or two clarifying questions that _weren't_ about context. It makes sense--they're both really good at improv and modeling each other's intentions. They treat the game as a medium, not an obstacle.

There's actually a good comparison to be made here. Brennan Lee Mulligan is the only D&D5e DM we respect whatsoever, and it's because he is willing to make the game a _medium for art._ Most other DMs play around it, tell a plot and the players play through it using the system. Brennan Lee Mulligan tells _stories._

Not every player is looking to play a beautiful game, and a beautiful game can take a _lot_ of energy. A lot of players, also, misidentify what's important: they favour plot and character, over the story. When Morgan is telling a story about the horrors of war and finding family under adversity, the plot isn't going to be "here's the horrors of war, now find family under adversity". The characters aren't going to stay the image the players have in their heads at the start, and a lot of players forget that, too. As our plot and story adapt, so too must the character.

In a beautiful game, the players have to take initiative. If your character is going to be passive, if you're only going to think the things you've written down about them, you're not going to find success. You have to correctly identify and match tone and flow, identify what the story is, to improvise _well,_ but you don't get better by asking Morgan for clearance every time you have an original thought.\
We have our pet peeves--players trying to be mechanical arbiters, characters or things from other settings--for similar reasons. If you're trying to give yourself a penalty, someone rolling against you a bonus, instigating a check, or choosing to fail something, you should be looking for a feature that says you can. Bad games like 5e encourage the opposite, and that isn't playing within the medium, it's trying to force an outcome with tools the medium has. Characters and things from other settings _aren't_ built for the medium, aren't built for the world, and come with baggage even if you think and say they don't. They've got prebuilt assumptions, and those are between harmful to antithetical to playing beautifully. 

Our best players, without exception, are brave, evocative, and riff off of us. They take context in account and build not in a vaccuum nor _only for specific context,_ but play within the medium and world. They do things that make sense, and make sense we can make _more_ with. I'm not saying every player needs to be morrigan or Malady, but it makes our job easier.

We play TTRPGs in part because we love spending time with our friends, and in part because we're here to play a beautiful game. If we can't do both, we're not going to like it much.
