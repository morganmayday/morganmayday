I recently had an occurrence where there was someone actively hurting people, who weren't going to take care of themselves and leave the situation without intervention. This was one of my enemies, direct and unadulterated, who I never planned to reach out to again. While the hostile intent directed at my contacts and friends could have an excuse or explanation, those excuses and explanations were preempting and preventing counterplay. \
If I directly stepped in and told my friends what to think, that would be a primary violation of their agency with net negative consequences. So I didn't. I talked, very simply, about safety, security, and [agency](/advice/agency). Any other choices were made entirely by them with full information; my scrying merely indicated that giving that information would allow them to take counterplay and have less bad of a time.

his is where I move onto the second topic: sucks. Sometimes, things suck. Sometimes, you've lost.\
I'm about to get real fuckin dark. Warning for that.

I'm really very serious. If you can't handle some grim shit, now's probably time to click off.

...I lean back against my chair, exhale. You have to understand, right, I'm not an activist or a dissident or any of that jazz, and if I was I wouldn't tell you. I know, however, that if broken properly, I would be a potential asset to fascist movements.

And that's really grim to think about! Fascist movements regularly target those I care about! And while I would call myself impossible to break, that is for a very, very key reason.

In opposed tactics and strategy, one of your goals is to deny your enemies every resource. If you are a breathing human being and not the Fascist Ideal, fascists will consider you either an enemy or a resource. If you are an enemy, you are to be turned into a resource, if that fails, you are to be destroyed. 

There's a saying, though I don't know where I heard it: "if someone puts a gun in your hand and tells you to kill your brother, there is only one target, and it's the one who handed you the gun." Fascists know about this. Fascists evade this as best as possible. As a strategist, you don't trust unwilling conscripts for a reason. 

I think you can see the outline of why this is grim. The more you improve yourself, the more you work on yourself, the more skills you gain, the more tempting a resource you are to your enemies if they can make you theirs. Resource denial. In tactics, even you at the top are a resource.

This segues into our third concept of the class, and a lighter one: dead time.\


I reset my half of the chessboard, take a drink from my glass. Truth is, you know, I've never really liked chess. Chess is not my game--it has perfect information. I thrive in the guesswork, the intuition, the strategy of reading your enemy like a book and stripping them of their advantages mercilessly. I'm definitely not the best tactician in a chesslike, I'll freely admit that, but give me a mirror match of any Magic: the Gathering deck I have a dozen reps on and I'll put on a show.

Chess gives perfect information to you freely. MTG treats information as a resource. This is why I say chess isn't an accurate conflict simulator--why do you think intelligence and counterintelligence are *sectors* rather than curiosities? When I do play chess, I prefer to play black. I want information as to how my opponent plays, because that's the only hidden information in the game.

Neither of these games are good tactical simulators. The thing with tactics, right, is that the cardinal rule of tactics is **Win**. Magic and chess don't do this, because it's generally frowned upon to eat pieces or mark cards. All games expect you not to cheat. This is why I don't think tactical simulators actually truly work.

There's a concept in tactics, that I'll refer to as offense/defense asymmetry, that draws on the concept of _asymmetric warfare._ You don't want to be playing the same game as your opponent--in fact, you almost never are.\
I see this error a fair amount in writing. A lot of people who write stories with a tactical aspect to the conflict don't know shit about tactics except basic principles. The underdog wins because they are _just better_, or they have a _secret weapon,_ or or or--and that's kind of got a kernel of truth, but...

I shake my head. The thing is, right, when I say offense/defense, the assumption most people will take from that is on the scale of grand strategy. In Star Wars, the rebels are the scrappy offense underdog, and the Empire is the defensive bulwark that outnumbers them a thousand to one. This doesn't mean any individual conflict or play within that broader scope is going to follow that dichotomy--blowing up Alderaan is proactive offense.





You've read Who's the Beatdown, right? I'll summarize. Mike Flores says in that article that the main way one loses a game of Magic is by misidentifying which is the control deck and which is the aggro deck. You might assume that this means "which is the defense and which is the offense," but there's another undertone to it--the control deck is the one that plays reactively, and the aggro one is the one that plays proactively. Generally, reactive strategies tend towards defensive and proactive strategies tend towards offensive, for one simple reason: the _make them have it_ rule.

"Make them have it" is a heuristic in hidden-information strategy of forcing your opponent to actually execute counterplay. It's why casting two threats in one turn is so strong in MTG--you're forcing them to counterplay . It's why proxy farming is a viable strategy in League of Legends. If your opponent does not act, they lose; if they do act, they can lose less, but you are already on to your next move with the tempo advantage.




At first brush, you might think that a defender always has an advantage. They have time to fortify, time to prepare, the ability to prepare. In a game with perfect play, symmetrical resources, and perfect information, it is a matter of who acts first, near every time. If you are on the defensive, reactive strategies are going to be the only real way to stem the bleeding the second your enemy gets a foothold. If you are on the offensive, proactive strategies are going to grind your opponent to dust. Let's talk about the red team.

The red team is a concept in cybersecurity, warfare, and the like, of a simulated attacker. The red team, given freedom of action, also nearly always wins. Why is this?\
The red team is not limited to _proactive offense._\
Don't get me wrong. Proactive offense is powerful. The best proactive offensives end a conflict before the adversary knows it's even begun. The red team, however, has the attacker's inherent advantage of first strike, combined with the ability to plan reactive offense for defensive actions they have intelligence or intuition on. In a well-done training exercise involving a red team, the defender doesn't know they're in a training exercise until after the red team has already finished recon.

The red team has the true advantage, in that they cannot be  In the moment, the only thing a defender can really _do_ is react, for one simple reason: proactive defense is a misnomer.\
See, a proactive defense requires foreknowledge and execution. Skilled attackers, 99 times out of 100, will have the information advantage and be able to predict and either completely avoid or partially mitigate a counterattack, so your goal is to strike first and catch them out.

This is why in real conflict, proactive defense is best executed through defanging your opponent before they can strike, _usually by being the offense._ If I know that my enemy is executing reconnaisance to prepare an incursion, my best option is to remove as many resources from their side of the field as possible. In strategy games, this is why I tend to play cutthroat aggressive--the attacker always has the advantage of tempo and momentum. If I act first, you must counter it. While you are countering it, I am already moving my second action into place, and if I'm good enough at what I do, it's going to be a threat before you've dealt with the first one.

In real conflict, proactive defense is best executed through defanging your opponent before they can strike.

There is no Magic Charm that can Never be Beaten, even in the environment it's specialized for. "Make them have it" is the heuristic of forcing someone to play reactively--commit your resources in a way that they *must* address or they lose, and while they're addressing it, you can strike elsewhere.
