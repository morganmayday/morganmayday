When I say I'm hacking something together, that's a very specific statement.

To create something on something else, to patch together a solution from disparate pieces onto an existing workflow, that's something I do all the time in computer science, and every time I do it, I later regret it. I'm not gonna stop, because it's often the most efficient way for me to learn--for example, I learned to write Nix by editing .nix files with no fucking clue what I was doing and then parsing the error messages--but it is bad practices.

Every time I hack something together, it makes the later issues worse. When my clock script broke my notification daemon, I had to spend hours troubleshooting, because it wasn't a solution from scratch--it was just a bunch of piecemeal lines I'd grabbed from other projects. If I'd just made it from scratch, and it broke, the troubleshooting would have been _easier,_ because the structure would have been Its.

Every time you hack, whether it's a fix in your head or a fix in your computer, you are taking a [parlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlay) that says:

-- This won't break anything else.\
-- The dependencies here will cause no harm OR go away on their own.\
-- This will be good enough to be a permanent solution if I never get around to it properly.\
-- This will do what I want it to do, and nothing else.

There is a reason you _do not take parlays in gambling._ The payout might be great, but it's irrelevant, because the odds are _long_ at _best._

I don't hack myself or my cognitive processes, ever. It's not worth the risk-reward. I engineer solutions instead; the goal of engineering yourself is to have a full and functional system that you can be happy with, not one that's _good enough._

When I see a system I want in myself, I build it off my core, every time. Sometimes, it requires other parts of my [cognitive firmware](/glossary#cognition), and when it does, I make sure I am happy with _every single piece I'm building it reliant on._ I have a full and functional system that I'm happy with, because everything I rely on to function is built off my core, my first principles, directly and tabs only other systems built direct off my core to work. 

Sometimes, there are things I _don't_ like in my me. I generally call this "legacy code". The solution to legacy code is, invariably, to remove it entirely.

This is something I can only do because I have built a full and functional system off my core.

Legacy code still affects my [mim](/glossary#self), but when I notice it, I can remove it safely, because the only things hanging on it are more legacy code. I don't need to worry about "I need this to cope", because if I do need it to cope and it's legacy code, tough shit, Morgan, it's time to sit down and reason out a replacement _within my system._

So: how do you do this?

The selves that people build by default tend to be haphazard things of ingrained response and unexposed incentive. In early 2024, we experienced what we'll call ego suicide. It took us about a year and change to build a self from there. This is because if you just kind of destroy your [You](/glossary#self), you still have that ingrained response and unexposed incentive going through. We functioned on...mostly reflex, with a couple false starts--selves we didn't end up liking--until we hit on re/constructing from first principles. From there, we were able to build internal machinery to create things that allowed us to tear out the legacy code that had covered similar functions--for example, the legacy code of "never kill yourself, because of spite", "treat yourself, because you deserve hedonism", and "you gotta expect more from others towards you" is now covered by "nothing is exempt from receiving kindness", off our first principle.

If you're not going to do ego death, you start where we did--write a first principle. Choose something that all else can stem from. Identify what you need, and rather than copying it over or hacking together something with it, build something _new._ Destroy the dependency dependency in your head--don't let yourself build vast nets of firmware interreliance where one bad piece sours the pot. 

Stop hacking yourself and start actually building something new.
