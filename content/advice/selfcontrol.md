Association with [To Desire](/advice/desire), amongst other things.

"The register" will require its own whole grimoire page. The working definition for this piece is "a tool in the [firmware](/glossary#cognition) layer that logs cognition, allowing for better metacognition."

-----

Minds, broadly, react to stimuli. The human animal reacts to stimuli in one way: thought.

For the purposes of this piece, _subconscious thought_ is any electrical impulse in the brain that results in consequence without being registered in what we call _the register._ These most often will be things like ducking at a loud noise, yanking your hand away from a hot stove, or flinching from a blow--sometimes, you will have them registered, but most of the time, the neuromuscular impulse happens without consulting you. These are things we would consider on the layer of [cognitive hardware](/glossary#cognition)--things that do not bother to be registered, because doing so wastes time that, evolutionarily, not wasting leads to a higher survival rate.

_Semiconscious thought_ is what a lot of people call emotion. These are reactions to stimuli that are noted in the register as buckets: "I am sad", "I am angry", "I am afraid". For some, it's hard to identify what these buckets are--we occasionally still deal with our register having "I am experiencing an emotion" as a line that doesn't elaborate and barely points to the actual chain. These emotion-label buckets don't happen out of nowhere, which is something a lot of people miss: if I am sad, that stems from stimuli that, within my model, is cause for sorrow.

_Conscious thought_ is what a lot of people call reason. These are reactions to stimuli that are noted in the register as coherent statements: "That's bullshit because," "that's cool as hell because," "I want this because". These are things that have displayed or hotlinked rationale--it may be "that's bullshit" instead of "that's bullshit because," but it has association that allows you to find why you think that.

Semiconscious thought and conscious thought are only different in their registration. This is why emotions vs reason is a false dichotomy. I've spoken with people who expect me to be speaking from one or another, and make false assumptions based on that; we speak, as much as possible, from [full stack](/glossary#full-stack), we practice metacognition actively and often.

This is why we bristle, when people speak of _self-control,_ of keeping their demons on a leash. To treat a part of yourself like something to be leashed, to be caged and kept in a box, is to block yourself from full stack cognition. If there is a part of you that wants to hurt others, to lash out, to do violence social, mental, or physical, that is something to be _changed,_ not _imprisoned._

To imprison your desire for violence is to validate it as something to fear. To grow and change is to narrow the list of fears that can provoke it, and to recognize when it is unproductive. If you've seen [the door](/glossary#the-door), you know what I mean when I say _you make every choice you make._ Violence is still an effective tool, it is still in our toolbox, but it is not something we _choose to use_ in anything less than exceptional circumstance.

If you think you have to control yourself away from harming others, you are 5&10ing yourself by committing to the counterfactual thought of your violence as something that you do not have a choice in. The truth is that every time you choose to hurt something, you _choose to do that._

To refuse the truth that you can also choose not to do violence is to sell your agency down the river and buy into [Mars](/glossary#mars).
