See, I say, you've heard "know thy enemy", played some chess, and read [Who's the Beatdown](https://articles.starcitygames.com/articles/whos-the-beatdown/) and now you have a basic grasp on strategy and tactics. But a "basic grasp" is only going to get you so far. Welcome to Tactics 101.

STRATEGY, I write on the whiteboard, and whack it with my marker. 

Strategy and tactics are not synonymous: this is _very_ important! Tactics serve strategy, not the other way round. Both inform each other. Just so that we're working with the same definition, let me tell you how strategy works.\
To Strategise, the first step is to identify your GOAL, then OBJECTIVES in service of it. Tactics are how you accomplish those objectives. This is the very simplest understanding I can boil it down to. 

"Morgan," you ask, "why teach tactics, not strategy, then?" Good question. I whack the whiteboard with my marker again. If you are trying to create a strategy with no fucking clue how tactics work, you will lose every time. Those objectives may not truly serve your goal, and you will throw whatever you've got with no true assessment of resources at them. This ends badly.

The zeroth tactical heuristic is *win.* If you can do this every time, congratulations on ascending to the victory dimension where you never lose, because this is impossible to do every time. You will lose. C'est la vie.

The first tactical heuristic is *never gamble when you can rely on skill.* Taking a fight you're suited for is always, _always_ better than taking a fight neither you nor your opponent are. Sometimes you don't have other options! But if your tactics rely on getting lucky, they are bad tactics.

The second tactical heuristic is *know what you can win.* The full Sun Tzu quote, as best as I can find it, is "It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle." This is often quoted as "know thy enemy", for obvious reasons with that fuckin quote length, but "know thy enemy" is _always_ going to miss half the equation.

"If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles." If I know my enemies are stronger than me in quality A, and I am stronger in quality B, I am going to build my tactics to take advantage of that. "If you do not know your enemies, but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one." If I know I'm strong in qualities A and B, and weak in C, I'll pick fights around A and B, but if my enemy is stronger in one of those qualities, I'm SOL. "If you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle." If I don't know that I'm weak in C, I will pick a fight around it and be completely SOL.

To distill it down further: if you can accurately identify your own strengths and weaknesses and those of your enemies, and correctly play around them, your victories will be off skill, not luck.

The third tactical heuristic is *play around information.* Sun Tzu and Machiavelli both spoke of secrecy being a key to victory, in--I check my notes--uh, The Art of War and The Art of War, respectively. Book titles are funny stuff.

In practice, this means: source your information reliably, know where it is falliable, and play with your cards unknown to your enemies as long as possible. Misinformation and disinformation can serve you well, and in knowing how those work, you can better identify when they are employed against you.

Now, there is a difference between between proactive and reactive tactics. As a general rule, proactive tactics can be best defined as "making them respond", and reactive tactics can be best defined as "responding". This means proactive tactics, whack whiteboard for emphasis, are _always_ going to be how you defeat your enemy. An enemy wearing themself out while you counter every move is a myth. Reactive tactics can be used to deplete enemy resources, but you've still got to finish the fight.

Proactive vs reactive =/= offensive vs defensive. A proactive offense is pretty simple to define and spot: by nature, every effective opening move is a proactive offense. Proactive offense starts at the word _go,_ and forces the enemy to respond.

This is why the red team is virtually undefeated, be it in cybersecurity or guerilla warfare or anything else. The attacker has the advantage of the first strike. If the defender reacts in an unanticipated way, the attacker can _react,_ and adapt their offense to the response, or they can continue to be proactive and just keep hitting harder. Any attacker that knows what they can win will pick the correct response every time.

So: what is a proactive defense? Reactive is simple to spot, it's employing tactics built ahead of time or on the fly to stem the bleeding or retake ground. A _proactive_ defense is _passive,_ one that does not need to be employed, one that the attacker always has to play around. A fortress wall or a surveillance system is a proactive defense. It may need to be maintained, and it needs to be built in the first place, but once it is in place, it does its job.

Thing is, the attacker can just play around that. There is no perfect proactive defense--I punctuate each word with a whack of the whiteboard. A good proactive defense is a link in a chain of risk mitigation. A good risk mitigation chain is robust, with multiple proactive defenses interlocking to close as many holes as possible, and used in tandem with reactive defense. If you blow a hole in my fortress wall, I should have a protocol for that. Ideally, I stop you from blowing a hole in the wall in the first place.

This is where a lot of people misunderstand how that's done. I could forge my wall from unobtanium, or I could build proximity noxious gas canisters into it so sappers and siege crews get fucked, or I could build it some kind of energy shield. This just means someone would fly over the wall. No matter what you do, there is no perfect defense. 

The way you stop someone from blowing a hole in your defenses is with proactive offense. If I notice someone sniffing around my fortress, I'm following them home and setting off every explosive device they have what could blow a hole in my defenses. Metaphorically, of course, but you get what I'm saying, right? There's always counterplay. The counterplay to that counterplay is to pick the fight for them, force them into a situation where they can't enact it, and that isn't doable with a lot of tactics, strategies, and even just situations. If you're trying to force corridor warfare, that's not going to work if they have a single explosive, so you have to actively, proactively, go out and remove their explosives by hand. If you're trying to force a grindy slugfest in a game of Magic, you've got to proactively hand attack out their removal to have any chance of winning. 

There is no perfect defense, but proactive offense comes the closest. Close the curtains, end the game, and do it before they can even react. That's the safest defense.

That's all I've got for you this week. Class dismissed.
