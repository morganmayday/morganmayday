tall evergreens, side by side with youthful all-but-saplings of less than a century, ground cover best described between 'rocky' and 'nonexistent'. the flame's burned down to barely more than coals, the woodsmoke long pervaded my skin. it's brisk, but i'm not gonna bother with a jacket. i love the cold, you see.

if there's one thing about me, it's that i can't resist telling a good story. 

i have this theory, right, that there are two types of good communication: _evocation_ and _explanation_. i like to evoke more than i like to explain, because if i've done my job well, i've evoked an explanation for you. show, don't tell.

She sits, beside me, and laughs a little at this. I know this, she says, and I love you. She doesn't feel the cold, not nearly as much as I do, but we both love it. Something about neurochemical balancing of nostalgia, she says, tells me that she doesn't know exactly why but that's what she'd guess, and i tell her she's explaining again.

She says that's her job. I can talk in riddles all I want, but she distills them, boils them down and cuts to the chase. 

people hate her for it. she's blunt, too blunt; she does not care for the social rigamarole when she can just _tell you how she feels,_ and be done with it. weasel-words are her enemy. if you fuck up, she'll tell you. she sees no use in niceties, thrives in the realm of efficiency, both linguistic and otherwise.

i say that's why we make such a good pair. i'm a storyteller. neither of us can politic well, of course, but where simple words won't suffice--my pen, as her sword.

People hate it for that. Getting it to talk in a straight line is all but impossible. Try thinking with it, and you'll find yourself in a Gordian knot faster than you can say "what the fuck are you even talking about". 

I say that's why we make such a good pair. Her vision is three steps ahead of mine. I can get her to sit down long enough to cut that Gordian knot and execute on it.
