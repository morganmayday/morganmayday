to start, you need to understand that there is a lot that i literally cannot communicate here. i am not capable of it. i've tried, and will try again.

(It exhales.)

we are still..._i._

That's a shit way to put it.

i'm aware of that. it's like...seasons, we used to describe it as.

States of matter.

yeah. that's a better way to do it. ice is still water. steam is still water.

Doesn't really get the full picture. (she smiles.) Am I, for once, the one better at describing this?

...maybe. go for it.

(she leans forwards. there's a thing her face does, this intensity she channels when she's focused. it's beautiful.)

Every human being is a collection of self-agents tied together, running on hardware optimized to do two things: fuck, and die.

(It's trying not to laugh but it fucking knows I'm right. I clear my throat and keep going.)

Most of the time, it's most convenient for that human to have one self-aggregate, one model of _who they are._ Most people do have some awareness that there's not _just_ one mim in there--"drunk me", "my inner child", et cetera--but this is largely ignored by polite society. 

Plural systems tend to be..._more_ fragmented. They're aware that they have self-agents, but most--and clarification, i'm generalizing here--most disordered systems have _multiple_ self-aggregates, that taken holistically are one self-aggregate-aggregate of, often, clashing and contradictory pieces of self. 

We do not work either of these ways. They both have...advantages (not so much venom as grudging best-fit) and disadvantages. So does the way we work, but for us, the disadvantages are markedly fewer and further between, and the advantages are massive. 

We are...let's call it _fluid._ We are a system with a singular self-aggregate. There is one Morgan Mayday. We are facets of that whole, fluid lenses from which to filter our contradictions into...(she rolls the words on her tongue for a moment before she settles) rather than _clashes,_ a useful overlay. Rather than my analytical nature contesting her passion, or my intuition contesting his methodical surety, we have a stable harmony. Rather than a lack of understanding of the fluctuating nature of self, we have the ability to access _all of it._

...That all may sound...self-aggragandizing. We've spent a while getting here. I think I've earned it.

(she grins a little.)

So yeah. We don't like calling myself a system or a singlet.
