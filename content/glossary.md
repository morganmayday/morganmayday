> Quick sidebar: all of these are the best working definitions I have to communicate with. Anything marked "borrowed from the void" is sourced from [here](https://voidgoddess.org/void/). I don't use all terms the same way, so I'm just marking the ones I'm using verbatim or slightly edited for brevity/interreferentiality.

### The Abyss
The metaphysical representation of the entropic probability well, the sum of its generals and more.

#### The Generals of the Abyss
Moloch, Mars, Naraka, Lethe. (Borrowed from the void.)
#### Lethe
Witch queen of oblivion seeking, the ghost lady of nightmares, the tendency to seek death as a form of escape after all other apparent paths have been closed. (Borrowed from the void.)
#### Mars
Demon god of might makes right. The brutal king of patriarchal power, the spirit of “I did it because I could, and because I could, I must.” Defined by defiance of Naraka in a way the is ultimately submission to it. The dark star of dictators and fascists, the dread lord of violence for the sake of violence. (Borrowed from the void.)
#### Moloch
Demon god of zero sum thinking, king of fear, destroyer of the stag hunt, lord of war, father of demons. (Borrowed from the void.)
#### Naraka
A metaphysical representation of the knowledge of the futility of your agency, which converts values into wounds, relevant information identified in projections into emotional meme-space by the example metaphor of death. Witch queen of submission to power. (Borrowed from the void.)

### Arts, the
Let's call them _magic._ A science we can most effectively talk about through evocation rather than description.

#### Artifice
One of the Arts. Associated with the first dimension, WHAT. The practice of creation.
#### Evocation
One of the Arts. Associated with the fifth dimension, WHY. The practice of choosing the perfect words, not necessarily definitionally but communicatively; showing, not telling.
#### Judgement
One of the Arts. Associated with the third dimension, WHERE. The practice of making a choice without room for doubt or regret.
#### Recognition
One of the Arts. Associated with the fourth dimension, WHO. The practice of seeing patterns, of retaining information.
#### Scrying
One of the Arts. Associated with the second dimension, WHEN. The practice of using intuitive models and gut calls to predict behaviour and outcomes.
#### Wizardry
The full-stack practice of the Arts towards a material goal.

### Cognition
The process of thinking.

#### Cognitive hardware
The brain.
#### Cognitive software
Self-agents believed necessary to the coherent presentation and/or function of who You think You are.
#### Cognitive firmware
Self-agents believed necessary to the function of cognitive software running on one's cognitive hardware. To cognitive hardware as cognitive software is to You.
#### Metacognition
Thinking about thinking.

### Data
Raw information. Can be filtered through the Art of recognition to begin constructing an intuitive model.

### The Door
The anti-inductive knowledge necessary to change. A threshold, a barrier, a boundary, and none of the above. Related to the Arts of judgement and recognition. _You make every choice you make._

### Full stack
The whole of one's being. See also self-aggregate. Carries with it the connotation of true fullness, of being able to use the entirety of one's cognitive hardware, firmware, and software towards a goal.

#### Full stack, fighting/playing/working with one's
Adjacent to what one might refer to as "being on their A-game", "total commitment", or "firing on all cylinders". Absolute will. Related to, primarily, the Art of judgement. Not realistically practicable with a discordant self-aggregate.

### Grok, or grokking
To understand wholly, on the levels of belief, knowledge, and intuition. Taken from Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land,_ not Elon Musk.

### Intuitive model
A mental model, using recognition, judgement, and evocation, of a person, force, or entity's past, present, or future actions. Often can't be accessed directly due to the sheer amount of information within being best filed on a subconscious layer. Enables more accurate scrying.

### Material
_(in context of goals, change, and the like)_\
A goal, change, or similar that you can _confirm_ the completion of.

### Self
The possession of distinct, individual identity.

#### Motive/incentive model
The internal structure by which a self-agent makes logical calculations. Can be shared between self-agents. Motive and incentive are not necessarily positive, negative, or accurate.
#### Mim
See motive/incentive model.
#### Self-aggregate
The whole of one's being. See also full stack. Can have connotations of discordance where full stack cannot.
#### Self-agent
A building block of being. "Agent" is borrowed from the void as the most logically primitive component of the universe that still performs logical functions.
#### Self-facet
A whole entity within a self-aggregate. In popular plurality, may be referred to as an alter. Sometimes will have its own self-aggregate, leading to a "self-aggregate-aggregate" situation.
#### You
_(capitalized)_\
The conscious portions of one's self-aggregate. What traditional psychology would be likely to classify as the ego.

### Consequence
A simple effect of your actions or lack thereof.
#### Counterplay
Any action taken _in consequence._
#### Retaliation
Counterplay that is excessive and destructive.
#### Xth-order consequence
A complex-chain consequence. Usually, "consequence" refers to a zeroth, first, or second order consequence. It goes deeper, but it is generally helpful to stop at simple consequences.
