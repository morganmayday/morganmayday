> Quick sidebar: all of these are the best working definitions I have to communicate with. Anything marked "borrowed from the void" is sourced from [here](https://voidgoddess.org/void/). I don't use all terms the same way, so I'm just marking the ones I'm using verbatim or slightly edited for brevity/interreferentiality.

Abyss, the: The metaphysical representation of the entropic probability well, the sum of its generals and more.

\- Abyss, the Generals of the: Moloch, Mars, Naraka, Lethe. (Borrowed from the void.)

\- \- Lethe: Witch queen of oblivion seeking, the ghost lady of nightmares, the tendency to seek death as a form of escape after all other apparent paths have been closed. (Borrowed from the void.)

\- \- Mars: Demon god of might makes right. The brutal king of patriarchal power, the spirit of “I did it because I could, and because I could, I must.” Defined by defiance of Naraka in a way the is ultimately submission to it. The dark star of dictators and fascists, the dread lord of violence for the sake of violence. (Borrowed from the void.)

\- \- Moloch: Demon god of zero sum thinking, king of fear, destroyer of the stag hunt, lord of war, father of demons. (Borrowed from the void.)

\- \- Naraka: A metaphysical representation of the knowledge of the futility of your agency, which converts values into wounds, relevant information identified in projections into emotional meme-space by the example metaphor of death. Witch queen of submission to power. (Borrowed from the void.)

Arts, the: Let's call them _magic._ A science we only really understand through intuition and evoking around exactly how it works.

\- Artifice: One of the Arts. Associated with the first dimension, WHAT. The practice of creation.

\- Evocation: One of the Arts. Associated with the fifth dimension, WHY. The practice of choosing the perfect words, not necessarily definitionally but communicatively; showing, not telling.

\- Judgement: One of the Arts. Associated with the third dimension, WHERE. The practice of making a choice without room for doubt or regret.

\- Recognition: One of the Arts. Associated with the fourth dimension, WHO. The practice of seeing patterns, of retaining information.

\- Scrying: One of the Arts. Associated with the second dimension, WHEN. The practice of using intuitive models and gut calls to predict behaviour and outcomes.

\- Wizardry: The full-stack practice of the Arts towards a material goal.

Cognitive hardware: The brain.

\- Cognitive software: Self-agents believed necessary to the coherent presentation and/or function of who You think You are.

\- Cognitive firmware: Self-agents believed necessary to the function of cognitive software running on one's cognitive hardware. To cognitive hardware as cognitive software is to You.

Data: Raw information. Can be filtered through the Art of recognition to begin constructing an intuitive model.

Door, the: The anti-inductive knowledge necessary to change. A threshold, a barrier, a boundary, and none of the above. Related to the Arts of judgement and recognition.

Dimensions, first through fifth: See [here](/grimoire/dimensions) for a quick-n-dirty til I can properly update it.

Full stack: The whole of one's being. See also self-aggregate. Carries with it the connotation of true fullness, of being able to use the entirety of one's cognitive hardware, firmware, and software towards a goal.

\- Full stack, fighting/playing/working with one's: Adjacent to what one might refer to as "being on their A-game", "total commitment", or "firing on all cylinders". Total will. Related to, primarily, the Art of judgement. Not realistically practicable with a discordant self-aggregate.

Intuitive model: A mental model, using recognition, judgement, and evocation, of a person, force, or entity's past, present, or future actions. Often can't be accessed directly due to the sheer amount of information within being best filed on a subconscious layer. Enables more accurate scrying.

Material, in context of goals, change, and the like: A goal, change, or similar that you can _confirm_ the completion of.

Self: The possession of distinct, individual identity.

\- Motive/incentive model: The internal structure by which a self-agent makes logical calculations. Can be shared between self-agents. Motive and incentive are not necessarily positive, negative, or accurate.

\- Mim: See motive/incentive model.

\- Self-aggregate: The whole of one's being. See also full stack. Can have connotations of discordance where full stack cannot.

\- Self-agent: A building block of being. "Agent" is borrowed from the void as the most logically primitive component of the universe that still performs logical functions.

\- Self-facet: A whole entity within a self-aggregate. In popular plurality, may be referred to as an alter. Sometimes will have its own self-aggregate, leading to a "self-aggregate-aggregate" situation.

\- You, capitalized: The conscious portions of one's self-aggregate. What traditional psychology would be likely to classify as the ego.
