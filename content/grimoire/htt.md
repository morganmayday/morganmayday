So you've met someone, and you think they might be a trans woman--maybe they've said as much, maybe they haven't, but you've _decided_ that they're in...however you define that category. You've got a couple options!

The easiest and simplest way to be transmisogynist is to refuse to recognize their womanhood. He/him and it/its can get you Cancelled, here in 2026, but of course they/them is an acceptable substitute, and your victim du jour can't really tell you off for it without looking like a lunatic SJW male. A key note is to *never* it/its a trans woman who actually wants those pronouns, you'll look stupid, or even worse--*accepting.*

Now, pronouns aren't the only way to do this--in fact, they may be the least effective. With pronouns, the trans woman will immediately know you wish them harm, because you will have hurt them. If you want something more insidious, you want *plausible deniability.* See, all a trans woman really wants is to be loved and accepted as who they say they are. You can play on this easily by making them perform womanhood even harder for you. If they don't do dresses, push them to do dresses, tell them they'll only pass if they do. If this means they start doing dresses, *move the goalposts.* Makeup, hair, nails, voice, surgeries, there are so many points you can hit.

If you prefer a carrot-and-stick approach, or are in a (ugh) *trans-accepting* circle, the personal favourite of many a softer hand is to "accept" them, ingratiate yourself with them, and treat them like a *real* woman. "But Leylune," you might wail, "that'll validate them!" Yes, that's the *point--* give them the carrot of acceptance, and its back edge becomes the stick. If you treat a trans woman like a real woman while they're meek, docile, and sexually subservient to you, you have leverage if they ever decide to grow a spine. Telling them you accept them, using their "correct" pronouns, and the like can let you extract a *lot* of value from a trans woman. If they step out of line, you can use your social capital to murder them to all their friends--the more dependent they are on you for their friendgroup, the better. If you're AFAB, you can always claim that they tried to rape you, and there's nothing they can do about that one!If not, or if you want a less-incendiary claim, *abuse* is something most lefty circles take seriously in the current day and age.

If, instead, you're a parent or caregiver seeking to *avoid* your charges growing into trans women, the steps are simple! If your boys show any sign of weakness, emotion, or anything of the like, punish them. Physical harm and bodily control work well, especially joined with humiliation. Look for boys that cry, care, or like the arts, they're most likely to be faggots of some kind or another, *especially* if they have no friends--children can sense weakness, use that to your advantage.

Now, you might ask, *why* would you do this? It's simple. Trans women aren't real women. They're pretenders, and if they *want* to give up their manhood, they're stupid as well as deceptive. Being a man is glorious and great, and the power--oh, the *power,* and they're throwing that all away? They're perfect targets if you just want to hurt someone. There's nobody more vulnerable than a multiply-marginalized trans woman, especially if you can even *hint* at a problematic kink. They don't actually have to have one, of course. Nobody's going to check.

One final note, on choosing your targets: self-described baedells and transfeminists will often be able to tell when you're targeting them, and as such should be avoided unless you have the social capital to oust them from their own circles, or other means with which to engineer their social--or physical! even better if it's physical--death. The best defense a trans woman has against you is to know that you want to make them your victim, and a group of friends who will stand by them even if you try for something like a rape accusation. Be careful, and pick your targets well.

Happy hunting!
