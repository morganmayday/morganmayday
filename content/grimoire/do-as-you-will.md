We say it a lot. _Do as you will._ Some people interpret it as disapproval, which is a fascinating phenomenon to me. It's not disapproval, not inherently.

What do we _mean,_ do as you will? It's simple. Do, as in take action, as you, as in _you,_ who You are, will, as in the future and the force of will. When I say "do as you will," you could interpret that as "you can do whatever you want forever," or "you're going to do what you're going to do," or "do whatever you decide to do," or "do what you want to."

And this is something that a lot of people who _don't_ simply [do the things they want to do](/advice/desire) don't really...parse, as the statement it is. _Do as you will._ Well, what if I will do something I don't want to? What if I will take an action I could and thus would? And I've spoken on that before, how it's selling your agency down the river, and this is something a lot of people don't seem to _get._

If you are doing something, you want to do it. You might also want _not_ to do it--you're capable of contradiction. We spoke on this in To Desire, but didn't really get into the how and why and what, just the practical of how to fight it. If you're reading this, you've read To Desire, you can probably use those skills by now; there's a reason I'm placing this in our grimoire site section rather than our advice section.

When I say _do as you will,_ I am saying "you are going to have to own the agency on these actions". I am saying "this is your choice". I am saying "you can do whatever you want forever". Oftentimes, if someone is in a self-destructive mode, comfortpilled, or has sold their agency down the river, this will sound like judgement. It is judgement--because you _can_ choose not to. It might be difficult, but the thing is, right, that with almost fucking everything this applies, _including OCD compulsions._ We have dealt with OCD compulsions in the past, and you know how we beat them? By choosing to disengage. It itched like hell, of course, every time, still does, but we can just choose not to do things we don't want to.

Thing is, we do also want to do them. This is how owning your entire self works: something within you wants to do every impulse (within a certain bound, I'm not talking about intrusive thoughts here, those are a separate phenomenon). We want to count crows because we, as a young kid, latched on to the idea of divination via bird as a way to tell if things were about to get Bad, and as such, counting crows let us feel safer, as long as it wasn't the Bad Number. We also don't want to count crows, because it was a behaviour that disrupted our workflow and stability, so we stopped. We still have to wrench ourselves away from it sometimes, but we _have_ the ability to choose, and always have.

_Do as you will._ We hear, a lot, fear from people we care about that they'll act on their most destructive impulses. This is another facet of do as you will--you can choose "I won't act on that". You can will that you won't. It's why the call of the void holds so little fear for us--there's no real world in which we do any of the self-destructive bullshit it calls out with, because we have decided we're not doing that.

This essay was provoked, in part, by thinking about someone we know who got really pissed when we expected them to have some amount of agency. This is alarmingly regular, especially in less-well-adjusted OCD communities. "My X made me Y" doesn't mean you didn't do Y, it just means you don't want to have that agency. **This is a bad thing.** If you have that agency, yes, you're responsible if you fuck up, _but you were already responsible if you fuck up._ There's a very clear [$10](/grimoire/5n10) here, and it's the world where you have that agency.

This is also related to fullstack, and [Emotions vs Reason, and Self Control](/advice/selfcontrol), which is funnily enough another essay I wrote. I am the whole of me, anger and fear and spite and hate just as much as care and love and hope and positive drive, and to deny myself that is to strip myself of power and agency, to launder my actions through a Worse Self. I am a very, very angry creature, and I don't lash out, and this isn't because I have my anger on a choke chain or in a forever box: this is because I do as I will, and I choose not to lash out, because I want to be kind. It's really, really simple, and every time I talk to folk who are so--_impressed,_ by this, who find this strange and occult and that there _must_ be more steps, I feel like I'm going insane, because this is fundamental to combatting rot.

If I can blame some of my actions on Naraka, on Mars, on Lethe, on Moloch, on however I choose to personify them, then _I don't have to feel like I have to change those._ I can just say "this is how it is", and move on, and that means they will be there forever. On the other hand, if I take responsibility for the entirety of me, I am forever driven to do better. 

This is why "do as you will" feels _hostile,_ to those who don't want to take ownership of their actions: it tells them "I will consider whatever action you take here to be _yours._" It reminds them that they have agency, and that even if they choose to forget that--I won't.
