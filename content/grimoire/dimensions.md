FIRST is WHAT. To exist, you must act. Action is of WHAT. If you can act, you are.

SECOND is WHEN. To scry something, it must first exist. Intuition is of WHEN. If you can scry, you are a second-dimensional thing.

THIRD is WHERE. To find something, you must first scry it. Navigation is of WHERE. If you can locate, you are a third-dimensional thing.

FOURTH is WHO. To know something, you must first find it. Cognition is of WHO. If you can think, you are a fourth-dimensional thing.

FIFTH is WHY. To pin something like a butterfly to a word, you must first know it. Language is of WHY. If you can communicate, you are a fifth-dimensional thing.

All things may have preference for one dimension or another, but exist across all five dimensions. Yes, the wall is communicating. It's communicating _barrier._ The wall is thinking, too, but that's another can of worms that I'll get to later.

_Evocation_ is the magic of the fifth dimension. It is the art of painting a picture in a single word. 

_Recognition_ is the magic of the fourth dimension. It is the art of connecting the dots.

_Judgement_ is the magic of the third dimension. It is the art of making a choice.

_Scrying_ is the magic of the second dimension. It is an intuitive prediction, a gut call, a lucky guess, a good model. Foresight is best practiced with the knowledge it will fail at random.

_Artifice_ is the magic of the first dimension. It is the act of creation.
