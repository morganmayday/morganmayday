I always find it difficult to define, describe, or even *outline* the door. It's not something most folks are accustomed to thinking about. Ra's [piece](https://voidgoddess.org/2022/12/10/there-is-a-door/) on it is hauntingly good, and helped me when I was first linked it--I recommend it fairly regularly, but I find myself, again and again, wanting to point people to my own words, and finding them unwritten. Let's fix that, shall we?

Required reading: [Do As You Will](/grimoire/do-as-you-will) and [Emotions vs Reason, and Self Control](/advice/selfcontrol)--Caroline touches on a lot of concepts around this in those pieces.

Recommended reading: Ra's [piece](https://voidgoddess.org/2022/12/10/there-is-a-door/) of the same title, and Opening the Door (linked at the end of that piece).

I've heard a couple theories in plural circles that the way society talks about "drunk me" or "angry me" or "hungry me" or "my inner (x)" or various other states as separate entities is indicative of more widespread plurality than anyone wants to acknowledge. It's more indicative, really, of a habit of *disavowing your own agency.*

If your inner child, your inner pedant, your inner lesbian made that choice, you can't really blame yourself for it. If you were drunk, angry, hungry, you can't really blame yourself for it--well, you can blame yourself for _losing control_ like that, but the choice...you were in an Altered State, not your Right Mind. Plural systems do this even harder, often; with the belief that consequences are rendered cruel because you're affecting others than the one who made that choice.

We find ourselves making circular-or-inane-seeming statements about why this is wrong, often.

These circle the door, but don't quite...evoke it. "'My X made me Y' doesn’t mean you didn’t do Y, it just means you don’t want to have that agency" is helpful to convey that you can choose differently, but it doesn't convey _why or how._

Emotions vs Reason is a dichotomy almost anyone will understand intuitively.
