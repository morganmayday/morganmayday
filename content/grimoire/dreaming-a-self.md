Who are you, when the lights are out and nobody's watching?


If you've been in broader plural circles before, adjacent at all to what we call "pop plur", you've met fictives, generally of characters from media. This is something some people--or rather, some People--judge plural folk as _lesser_ as a whole for. This is also adjacent to the endo/exo divide as a concept: systems saying "well, _I_ have a reason to be like this, but they don't so they're not real/worthy of respect, they're doing it for internet points." Respectability politics is an unwinnable game.

For the purposes of this essay, we're going to define being a fictive as being *primarily* fictive matter, the story of self you tell being based primarily in your interpretation of a concept or character, not necessarily from media or writing. This includes what's often called _factives,_ which are interpretations of real-world characters (anecdotally, often as persecutor characters based on the system's former or present abusers). 

So: why do fictives _happen?_


Your soul is where you make every decision ahead of time. Every decision you've made, already encapsulated and known, by the circular nature of _this is what you will choose in any circumstance, because it's what you choose._ This isn't to say you don't have free will, simply that your soul is the perfect reflection of that free will, that self-perpetuating agentic loop. You aren't cosmically preordained to do anything; your soul is simply the _perfect fidelity model_ of what actions you will choose to take in any situation, updating as you change. Human beings, generally, seem to be most stable at one, two, or three souls.

Your self, broadly, is how you make your soul make sense--this is an abstraction to make this easier to parse, but do be aware that it is an abstraction. This doesn't mean there's not incongruous shit--for example, abusers that consider themselves Good People--this just means that there's a fairly straight line between your perceived reality, your self, and your soul. There's a concept, called [pataphysical transduction](https://voidgoddess.org/void/#transduction), where your self/soul can be overwritten by a _more robust_ self/soul depicted with high enough fidelity; this is partly so fucking hard to do because generally perceived reality is fairly solid. One of the ways pataphysical transduction can most easily affect someone is if they're dealing with a shakeup of their reality. This is related to fictives.

So: if humans are most stable at one, two, or three souls, how does that work outside those numbers?


I can't really talk about souls without mentioning the capability to not have one. Generally, that soul has been optimized out or neglected to borderline nonexistence under the coercion levied by Consensus and other forces. I wouldn't say zero-soul humans _truly_ don't have souls, I'd simply say that for practical purposes they don't--a zero-soul human outsources most to all of their decisions to their model of Consensus, and won't choose to stop doing that without outside intervention. For its part, Consensus makes staying within it as easy as possible and veering outside it as hard as possible; as an example, most people choose not to break the law because it's illegal to do so, not because they think of the specific illegal act as wrong. Zero-soul humans are as stable as Consensus is.

Above three souls is inherently unstable. The human hardware does have limits--every system I've met with 4+ selves usually has multiple selves to at least one of their souls, or has 4+ souls _temporarily,_ collapsing down to a stable number at some point. My working theory is that 4+ souls happens due to drastic shakeups in perceived reality necessitating change of self and soul, but communication divergence or stubborn tendencies leading to one or more souls refusing to change. At 4+, you also start becoming less able to act as [fullstack](/glossary#full-stack), with distance-between-souls and signal degradation leading to a loss of coherence. Systems that stay at 4+ souls for extended periods of time tend to be ones with major amnesia barriers.

So: why do so many systems seem to pick up fictives, if there's this hard limit on souls?


When you don't have a substantial self, that's what we refer to as _dust._ This generally comes from being broken into not having much of one anymore, generally for the purpose of Something getting at your soul to pare it away slice by slice by slice. This is related to why pataphysical transduction works, and this is why the Fictive Problem exists. The less substantial of a self you have, the more you will have to assemble one, the more the selves you see in the world affect you, the more you are likely to borrow pieces of them--and if you're primed in certain ways, like plurality, you are likely to split them. These selves aren't used to reflect _new souls;_ they're used to reflect existing souls better. If I split John Fromtv tomorrow, it would be because my interpretation of John Fromtv lined up as well or better than my existing self, with my perceived reality and soul. This is a lot of why systems that when they get attached to characters generally split them have _types;_ those types line up well with their soul(s) and perceptions of reality. The other main reason fictives happen is that having your perception of reality damaged enough, like how abusers generally do in order to easier abuse you, is condusive to both imagination and a plurality (heh) of selves. The more your perception of reality changes or is changed, the easier it is to simply have a different self for that rather than to adapt your self or recenter your perceptions.

This is related to why persecutors happen, and why generally "factives" are based on real-life abusers. A system that splits persecutors has a soul that wants to hurt others and/or themselves, which on large occasion happens because they can no longer imagine a life without someone that lashes out in it. There is a certain solace found, in having control over the harm, even if it's only a part of your whole with that control. 

A large part of what we call the Fictive Problem is how fictives tend to, beyond a few characteristics or traits of their source interpretation, _flatten_ or vanish over time. This is generally because folk grow, heal, and change, or because someone is _trying not to._ Stasis is death. To remain static, you must carve away all within you that can grow and change, a continuous pruning violence unto your self and soul. If you prune a tree enough, it becomes a rotting slab of wood. On the other end, a fictive that flattens or vanishes over time because the system is growing, healing, and changing does that often because the soul or model of reality changes, and a new or regrowing old self is a better fit. Sometimes, the self a fictive is will _drop the fictive_ as it grows--Caroline was a fictive, not of a Caroline but someone else, and dropped that as she grew and changed into something new, but she is still the same underlying structure, just different. Sometimes, a rotting soul will conjure fictives as a method of faking growth--they can also do this with non-fictive selves, but it is easier to do with fictives, so it tends towards fictives.
