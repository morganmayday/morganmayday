With thanks to Ra, for talking about this in a way that changed my life, and morrigan, for introducing me to its work, amongst other things.

----

Personhood is a tool of violence used by Authority, a perpetual threat used to separate Desirables and Undesirables. When any Person considers a group or being Undesirable, they often decry that group or being as not a person, as subhuman, as no better than _animals._ You can see this happening--well, anywhere you look, really, but most definitely in USAmerican politics as we speak.

There's a pretty common line--"if [x] are people, then they deserve our respect"--that really points this out. By stripping a being of its personhood, you can just kind of do whatever you want to it and it's socially acceptable to anyone who agrees with you. Animal rights activists are considered jokes in the majority of society--while Cute Puppy #438799852 might get "aww"s and compassion, that's because it is lucky.

This is, at best, dangerous. In practice, this is absolutely vile.

To [quote](https://voidgoddess.org/emptyspaces/notaperson/):

> We care about people! We’re good! We’re moral! They scream themselves blue in the face insisting it while beating you to death and passing laws which make your existence a crime. Human rights only apply to humans and your humanity only exists when it’s useful to them. You only have value as long as you can be a useful token to fight over, as long as you do things for them and don’t ask for too much back, as long as you smile and cheerfully bear their cruelty, as long as you don’t make them uncomfortable. Of course, even then they’ll turn on you eventually. 

The [UN Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) is treated, broadly, as a joke when it comes to those who have been unpersoned. Granted, I consider it a cruel joke as well, but for different reasons. If you want an easy example, Article 12 reads as follows: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."\
So helpful! I wonder what the list of countries is that neither have nor use prisons, considering how badly that interferes with someone's privacy, family, home, and correspondence. What's that? Only the Vatican and Liechtenstein don't have prisons, and they _transfer criminals to other countries' prisons?_

Now, you might be saying, "well, that says arbitrary interference, prosecution for a crime isn't arbitrary," and to that I say: holy fuck have you been living under a rock? Even if you insist that wrongful prosecution only happens because the US has racial profiling problems, _do you think the rest of the world is immune to profiling?_ Even if you do, even if you think every innocent defendant is found innocent, do you think that being the subject of a criminal investigation somehow doesn't attack your honour and reputation? Article 12 doesn't say "arbitrary attacks", it just says "attacks". A retraction of charges doesn't mean you were never considered a murderer, a thief, a cheat, whatever. Doesn't mean you won't be considered one, either.

Your personhood is a tool used by Authority to keep you in a box. As long as you sign away your soul, you can be a person too, they tell you! Of course, they're lying--your personhood ends the second it's inconvenient, the second you break their rules a smidge. Buy into this, they tell you, and you are safe from other people! Everyone else buys into it, so you need to buy in too! Oh, well, if you got hurt, that was just a monster, an evil person who just needs to get caught. Oh, well, if a system of power hurt you, well, would you blame God for hurting you? We just want every person to be safe!

Buy into our scheme, or we hurt you. Isn't that called a protection racket?

This is, in the end, why I'm not a person.\
I refuse to be complicit, to buy back into the racket, to exert pain onto others for the simple crime of being Not A Person. I'm vegan for the same reason. To hurt another just because it isn't within The Ingroup, the bought-in club, those who get Rights as Human People--that is not something compatible with who I want to be. Everything deserves compassion, and I am not going to bother caring whether it's an animal being bought and sold and murdered or an animal with a gun pointed at its head told to waste its life and body for the capitalist machine so that it can continue to eat and have a roof over its head.

For a very long time, I had to consider myself a person, just to get myself to _respect_ that I had wants and needs and deserved to get them. I had seen behind the curtain enough to know that People get Rights, that People get Respect, and I thought I had to learn to be a Person so that I could be respected, so that I could be anything but an object to those who hated me. Down that road lay madness.\
"If I buy in, then I get rights," is not something that works when any Person can look at the little piece of paper that says you get them and laugh in your face. Fascists do not care if I think of myself as a person: they care that I'm Fair Game under their model, some kind of faggot they're allowed to beat to death because I'm not actually a Person.

To be a person is to acknowledge the legitimacy of the racket, to cede to it. "Sure, Morgan might not _call itself_ a person, but really that's just a political statement and it deserves all the same compassion as a person." You see where this statement is flawed, right? You're making an exception, to the overarching scheme of "people deserve respect", a concession to the fact that I will not lie down and take it if I'm treated poorly.

To not be a person, on the other hand, is a large part of disavowing the protection racket entirely.
