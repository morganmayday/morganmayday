I've seen it, again and again and again. The woman who speaks up, who says something, and how the temperature of the room, the chat, whatever, drops *instantly.* I've been that woman many a time, it's not fun--so, many folks just shut the fuck up.

And that's fine, right? Don't need to kill the vibe, especially if everyone around you will look at you weird for it. If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all, you know?

Think with me, for a second, about the example in the beginning. "Hey man how's it going?" Polite. Normal. Casual. The kind of thing you get asked all the time. Just a turn of phrase, right? Gender neutral, right?

Except it clearly isn't, though. "Man" is a specific gender, or category thereof. Even if *when you say it* it is *meant* to be neutral, you are conveying your implicit biases, and it does not come across as neutral.
