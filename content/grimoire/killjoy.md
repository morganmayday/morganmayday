There is a tendency to assign neutrality to the masculine form of words in English, mostly in slang--"hey, man," "hey, dude," "king shit"--though it shows up sometimes in general phrasing still, feminist pushes mostly have made things like "fireman" over "firefighter" obsolete. This is, overall, something most people do, and something most people find pretty harmless. A lot of people will go through their lives not thinking about it, or thinking about it a tiny bit at most.

This is indicative, on the whole, in a similar way to how things like "girl math" or "girl dinner" or "I'm just a girl" are indicative. If you think about how "girl math" is used, it's as a devaluation. "Girl dinner" is the same. "I'm just a girl" uses *just* as the qualifier. You could conceivably say "girlboss" has positive connotations, if you like bosses, or ignore the fact that "girlboss" is usually used to talk about a woman who's done something kinda fucked up, or ignore the fact that it's tacking on a feminine qualifier to a word in such a way that it assumes inherent masculinity of *boss*.

Generally, neutral-word attempts are clowned upon. I saw people attempt to start using "folx," "Latinx", "Mx.," and the like, and there was consistent confusion and mockery over the X's--Mx. survived, because there was no competition in its niche. Others weren't so lucky. Some nonbinary-specific neutrals, such as "joyfriend," do still see some use, but are generally rejected by nonbinary communities, as there are better neutral alternatives pre-existing. That's a regular pattern: sometimes, something *already exists,* and as such very few folk will adopt the designed neutral. Why adopt "folx" when "folks" doesn't have any gendered connotations in the first place? Who does it exclude?

There's a pattern in who's socially allowed to respond poorly to soft misgendering like this. In trans-accepting circles, calling a transgender man "girliepop" is, rightfully, recognized as invalidating. Cisgender men also react *really poorly* to any perceived threats to their gender, and are encouraged to do so in every circle. If you call a cisgender man a girl, he's encouraged and obligated to take that as fighting words. Very few cisgender men, and ostensibly cisgender men, react well to the suggestion that they *might not be men,* because masculinity matters to them.

On the flip side of the coin, cisgender women are *discouraged* from reacting poorly to threats to their gender. A lot of lesbians who are ingratiated in majority-cis-male circles are considered "one of the guys," and that's considered a compliment. If a woman is in a group, and someone addresses the group as "guys," pointing that out will be a Whole Thing, versus the inverse scenario, where it's considered normal. "Guys, and Sarah," is irregular, versus "Girls, and Jeff," which is normal. 

Transgender women, in particular, are socially discouraged from reacting to threats to their gender. If I call a man "lady," he's socially allowed to pick a fight with me over that--but if I call a transgender woman "dude," that is normal, par for the course, and happens continually even in trans-accepting circles. If she asks me to stop doing that, she has to ride a thin line--either do it in public, and kill the vibe, or do it in private, and risk other people thinking it's acceptable. The safest option for her is to grin and bear it. You can see this too, if you look. Keep an eye out, and next time you see a tgirl publicly stand up for herself, watch as the temperature of the room drops, as chatter doesn't quite pick up the same again, even if everyone ostensibly responds well.

This is all rooted in how society treats masculinity and femininity. Even in 2026, after wave after wave of feminism, there's still a pretty clear assumed dichotomy. Masculine people are strong, and resilient, and persistent, and worthy. Feminine people are weaker, more emotional, more vulnerable, more unreliable. Sometimes this is swapped out for "men" and "women," "males" and "females," "AMABs" and "AFABs," but it's all really routed the same, just with some minor phrasing differences. So: what happens when someone willingly rejects that masculinity? Either they have to perform that femininity well enough to be considered Women, or they get *othered,* and the assumed femininity--why do you think so many transgender women struggle to stand up for themselves? If they don't play to that bleak picture of femininity-as-uselessness, they risk being socially--or physically--murdered, *especially* disabled trans women, *especially* trans women of color.

When you get *othered* for not fitting that picture of womanhood, for having a spine, people begin to treat you as neither a man nor a woman nor however they treat nonbinary folk. You lose your right to gender and become, in their eyes, just a bitch.
