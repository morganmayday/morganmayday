Quick note: these are loose notes assembled from our thoughts. This is significantly less refined than anything else we've written.

A lot of people think about "ego death" as terrifying. There's a line, past which You no longer exist--of course that's scary, isn't it? It's the void, the unknown. Others who pass it speak of it flippantly, like it wasn't so bad after all, and that's, for some, confusing, for some, terrifying, for some, intriguing.

Ego _suicide_ and ego _murder_ are concepts plural systems will probably understand more intuitively than singlets. To have an alter kill oneself or another, that's old hat to most anyone in proximity to pop-plur--even if it hasn't happened in your system, I can almost guarantee it's happened in the system of someone you've known.

Thing is, this isn't, often, final. Not really. Sure, Bravo died in the narrative you construct that contains You, but she'll be back in two months when she's needed again, or maybe Victor will take up her components and she'll be shuffled back into the rota of faces to have nightmares about, or maybe Delta will kind of merge with her and end up becoming someone that's got the whole of both of them. There are, of course, exceptions, but this is generally the shape of things.

All of this is because their narrative is left intact. When an alter--and I should note, I use "alter" here because even though we loathe the term, it's the cleanest shorthand available--dies a true death, the narrative construct they inhabit is rendered unusable and unsalvageable. This is often a good thing. Alters die final deaths because they are no longer needed, mostly.

When I say _narrative construct,_ to be clear, I'm referencing the first layer of narrative, which is narrative-to-self. Any self is a narrative you tell yourself about yourself. This doesn't mean it's not real, it just means it's unreal. You _can_ function without a narrative construct. We've done it. It's not...great, for long-term health and stability, because not having a story to tell yourself about who you are means that you're just kind of your raw choices and the story you tell the world about who you are.

Ego suicide and ego murder rarely stick because destroying narrative construct is a magic that people don't really ever consider. A lot of systems who do ego murders and ego suicides come back in about two months--this is a noted cycle time actually, though the data's anecdotal--and that's often because those systems are so fucking cooked on the agency front that they don't realize that permanent change is _possible._

It's also, like, not a sure thing? Ego death is hard to artificially instigate without exterior influence. Even if it's instigated, a lot of plural systems with any self-preservation instincts will try to fight it. I'm not the greatest at talking about that angle, we don't think of ourselves as plural and the stress around a lot of situations that instigate ego death is high enough it kicks our memory into the backseat to give us more processing power.

I won't go into the details of our system's experience, with being an abusive piece of shit and changing by fire. I will say, simply, that the person we were is dead and never coming back, and this is part of why "you can't expect me to change my behaviour!!" pisses us off so bad. It took us killing the person we were to be able to change! _We still did it!_

This is actually part of why I think ego death is a useful tool: to become who you were again, you have to rebuild yourself. Not everyone does that well, usefully, efficiently, or beneficially, but it's a lot harder for rot to prosper in fresh structure.

At least, when the rot isn't in the structure from moment one.
