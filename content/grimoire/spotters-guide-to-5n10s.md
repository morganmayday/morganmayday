With thanks to Ra, for talking about this in a way that changed my life, and morrigan, for introducing me to its work, amongst other things.

I've found, talking to people--especially those experiencing OCD--that teaching them what a 5&10 is can be really helpful! The issue is, a lot of them don't have the tools to recognize when they're doing it to themselves. Ra talks about it in a way that was really, really effective for getting me to understand--

> So back to the table, you have $5 and $10. Why might you take the $5? Well, what if the $10 is poisoned? What if it’s counterfeit? Why would someone give me the option of taking it if the other option is better? Are they trying to trick me? What are they trying to trick me with? Is this like Newcomb’s Problem? Is this a boobytrap? Am I being set up by Omega? Are there cameras rolling? 

--because this is a similar flow to how I thought for a very long time. Evaluating as many possibilities as you can, as quickly as possible, is something that can be beneficial in very specific crisis situations, and something that used to make me _really_ prone to 5&10s. I still find myself getting hit by it sometimes, when I end up branching too fast to _actually evaluate_ and just end up fearing everything on the way down. Let's call this kind of 5&10 the **branching 5&10**--it is characterised by running down a thousand branches and concluding, because those branches exist, that taking the 5 is _safest._ This is the stage of a 5&10 that gets you things like cops--"we _need_ cops, you see, to keep the peace, because think of all the horrible things people will do without them!"

A lot of the people I've talked to have said "well, I'm not 5&10ing myself, because I'm not making up a bunch of reasons, I'm just taking the safer option". Let's call this kind of 5&10 the **hiding 5&10**--it is characterised by being unable to see the branching process that happens, and just sticking to the one reason made. This is the stage you get once you've incorporated the counterfactual conclusion you came to as data. This gets you things like "I can't talk to children, because that would mean I'm a predator." 

The last stage I want to talk about is the **ominous 5&10**. This is what you get either before the branching, or after you've 5&10'd yourself so long you can't recall the counterfactual reasoning you had. The place you see this most in society is "it's just not _done_," enforced by societal norm. This is what makes a lot of people never _consider_ going vegan. I see this most in my personal work with compulsions. "If I don't/do this specific thing, Something Bad Will Happen."

I've called all these stages, because I don't really think they're separate things. They all manifest in the same way--a counterfactual conclusion being used to justify your actions and inactions. I don't make the distinction when I'm thinking about them! This is just a tool to identify them, if you're struggling with that.

So: how do you fight a 5&10?

The line that stuck with me, back when I first read Ra's essay, was "_stop summoning counterfactual demons based on your worst fears_". Beating one 5&10 isn't going to save you from the rest of the horrors you've conjured to predestine your behaviour, and it won't stop you from continuing to conjure them.

> The way out is not by trying to puzzle out how to avoid having to acknowledge your made up reason that wrong is right, it is to denounce the demons outright. _**There can exist no such reason.**_
> 
> And if you do that, and you find that you are doing something for a hallucinated reason, in service of an evil god from a nightmare realm, out of the fear of what a just world would do to you, don’t scry for a new reason why this is actually okay, just _stop serving the evil god._ Do better.

> To retrocurse my own evil and put my money where my mouth is I’m going vegan.
