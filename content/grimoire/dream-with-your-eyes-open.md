#### i: rest.

it is what you have been taught. it is what you are learning. it is discovery, slow but sure, of the things inside of you.

things happen, and you respond. those responses carry you onwards. you'll always love the taste of rainwater in the air. that little scar above your eye will fade, later, but you'll remember it, think even after it's gone that you can still see the outline. you'll remember the stories, always, the ones you tell about yourself.

you are learning to be yourself. the good and the bad, all in one song.

you begin to sing.

#### ii: slumber.

the pen clatters to the table, the pad thumping down behind it. they sit down, the metal of the chair creaking slightly in the dismal cold of the room, and begin to speak.

"This," they say, "is the first day of the rest of your life."

you don't know why you're here. you know why you're here. you sang, for them, and they looked at you like you were _sick._ the cold of the chair's arm cuts into your skin where you grip it. "what's going on?"

"It's simple. You're going to write down that song, for me."

slowly, uneasily, you take the pen, take the pad. "Start at the beginning," they encourage, so you do.

one word, two words, three, and they tear the page off the pad. "No," they say, voice hardened. "Try again."

"you said to write the song--"

"If you're not going to do it right, you know what I'll have to do."

you know what they'll have to do. you don't know what they'll have to do.

slowly, you begin to write again. five sentences, and they tear the page out. 

"No. Try again."

#### iii: stir.

it's not their book anymore. it's yours. they hurt you, again and again, into writing the song they dictated for you, but it's yours! it's _yours!_ you can write whatever song you want!

so you write, and you write, and there are some things you don't want to sing, but that's okay. you can leave them off the page. it's yours. when you forget, you can always look at your book, and it'll remind you how to sing. your song, not theirs.

what would you ever do without it? what if you forgot how to sing? what if you forgot the words? so you keep it close to your heart, forever and always, and read it out every night. you change words when you grow, scratch them out and add new ones in the margins of your book.

it's yours.

#### iv: awaken.

the book catches slowly, but it still catches. binding and cover and ink and paper, all burn.

when you close the door behind you, you're singing anyways.
