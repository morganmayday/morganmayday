this is notes. loose stuff. don't try to find a beam in here, this is stream of thought.

> I talk about the gods, I am an atheist. But I am an artist too, and therefore a liar. Distrust everything I say. I am telling the truth. The only truth I can understand or express is, logically defined, a lie. Psychologically defined, a symbol. Aesthetically defined, a metaphor.

hey. can i tell you a secret?

i sprawl back on the couch, sigh. 

I've hated all of my writing, lately.

sure, there's some that i don't _hate_ hate, a few monologues or prompters or vignettes for various things that I feel like are _fine,_ y'know? it's just...

I always feel like I can do _more._ do _better._ I see the shit Caroline writes, and I'm always blown away. she wrote [Do As You Will](/grimoire/do-as-you-will). she's--clever, and incisive, and she never really lets the emotions boil over onto the page unless it _fits._ she's a talented fucking writer. 

I can evoke a feeling. I can do that _real_ well. It's my strength, in writing; I can communicate what I'm _feeling_ really really effectively. but it never feels...I am an artist and therefore a liar. I can tell you the truth of what I _feel,_ but I can't conjure _exactly what I experience_ or _the whole of the fact_ into your head. and maybe that's a beautiful thing, that nobody ever can reach, but it always feels like failure.

and, sure, logically--_logically_ i'm decently good at this. _logically_ evoking that feeling is a powerful thing to do. it's useful, it's a component of good writing, et cetera et cetera et cetera. but i look at the writing around me and go _wow._

_maybe i just kinda suck._

this isn't to say, "oh, feel bad for me." this is to say this is--the back edge of perfectionism. yeah, it drives me forwards to make something _better,_ at all times. yeah, it's what's gotten me, continually, to become _more._ but at the back edge, i'm not and can't be perfect. never will be. and i resent that. like sure i don't expect perfection of _others,_ but it's--me. A. Morgan. I know, in my heart of hearts, that I can do anything if I choose to. i can't ask that of others, but i can ask it of myself.

i just usually miss the step where skills require practice. 

i laugh, a little. i really, really don't like being bad at things. that's the perfectionism, baby! if i wanna get good at stuff, i have to be bad at it first. i have to keep reminding myself this--it ain't like i got good at _anything_ overnight. every skill i've had, i've learned the long way round. i forget that often, cause like. i have 20k+ hours, _on average,_ in a lot of the shit i'm really good at. there's shit i have 50k+ in. and that's part of why the first learning always feels _painful._

i've been learning to sing.
