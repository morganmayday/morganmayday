"I don't want to do this" is a very simple statement.

We live in a world where we have to do things we find unpleasant.\ 
I do not like brushing my teeth. I also have to brush my teeth.\
It's worse, for a lot of folk in school or assignment-based workspaces. A lot of the time, you have to suffer through boring, routine, difficult but not challenging, or overly challenging tasks, and those _suck._ I don't like doing them. They do not bring me joy; this is why I'm not currently planning on going back to college.

I do not like brushing my teeth. I brush my teeth every night.

Sit here with me and think about it, okay? Pick a task, any task, you find unpleasant, and chase it with me. This won't necessarily be pleasant, but it'll be good practice.

What are the [simple consequences](/glossary#consequences) of not doing this task? If I don't brush my teeth tonight, I'll wake up with my mouth feeling like it's full of sand. What are the [complex consequences](/glossary#xth-order-consequence) of not doing this task? If I don't brush my teeth tonight, I make progress towards needing a root canal.

This part is helpful, but it's often not enough. You also have to go down the inverse track.\
What are the simple consequences of doing this task? If I brush my teeth tonight, I feel better in the morning and I get better sleep. What are the complex consequences of doing this task? I can keep my teeth for longer, and hurt less. 

I want to feel better in the morning and get better sleep. I want to keep my teeth for longer, and I want them to hurt less. I want to not wake up with my mouth feeling like it's full of sand, and I want to not need to have a root canal. I can weigh those desires against "I don't want to get up and brush my teeth", and those desires will win out. When I worked at my last job, the desire model was often "I want to get out of the house and stay sane, I want a paycheck next week, I want to not bedrot all day, I want to not get fired so I can continue getting paychecks."

To build these models is something you have to do continuously, especially if you have trouble building habits. I can't just build that "brush my teeth" model once, I have to do it every night. The tricky part, at first, was remembering to do it; then fighting my brain. Remembering to do it was easy enough for me--I linked the feeling of changing clothes to thinking about brushing my teeth--but if you're having trouble, I cannot recommend enough phone alarms and sticky notes.

The "fighting your brain" bit is different, though.

If you are fighting your brain on one of these desire models, it is, simply, because there are more desires you aren't taking into account. If I wanted to burn my hand on the stove cause my buddy offered me $5000 and my medical bills to do it, my cognitive [hardware and firmware](/glossary#cognition) would rebel with the desire of "I want to not burn myself". 

So: you analyze it. You expose those desires. If they do not hold up to logical scrutiny, sometimes what you have to do is gently tell your brain "let's just try this once, and I promise it won't be as bad as you think, okay? We'll feel better after." To fight yourself is to lose, one way or another.

Let's take the "going to work" loop.\
I want to get out of the house and stay sane, I want a paycheck next week, I want to not bedrot all day, I want to not get fired so I can continue getting paychecks, and yet sometimes going to work would be insurmountable. I would not physically want to get up and leave for work. It would feel like fighting my brain to do so.\
So why did my brain want not to go to work?

I don't think laziness exists. When you think about any desire like this, there's almost always a _fear._ When I didn't go to work, it was because I was afraid: maybe afraid of being mistreated by customers and coworkers, maybe afraid of being given physical tasks beyond my capabilities and contract, both of which were very reasonable fears! Both of which happened regularly! I wasn't going to be able to tell my brain "let's try this once, and it won't be as bad as you think," not without lying to myself. I got hurt at the end because the job wilfully disrespected the physical health of myself and other workers.

On the flip side, when I was first thinking about going vegan, I was afraid of being judged. And while yes, that was a fear that was technically correct--people judge all the time--it is one that is _ultimately harmless._ I'm capable of dealing with judgement over a choice I've made to align who I am and who I want to be. Ultimately, while a lot of society negatively judges me for that choice, the outcome of "aligning myself further with who I want to be" is infinitely more rewarding than "some dipshits ask intrusive questions or laugh at me" is punishing.

That, if anything, is the benefit and the danger of this. There's an ancient folk saying: "if it sucks, hit da bricks". Sometimes, leaving the situation is the only way to make your life better. Sometimes, leaving the situation will give you new, worse problems. Often, you won't be able to 100% identify which is which. 

If it's hurting you, though? If it's something you and [You](/glossary#self) are at odds on, and You have to admit you kind of have a point? Well, if you're prone to [5&10s](https://voidgoddess.org/2023/03/27/demons-from-the-510verse/), you should get a trusted set of eyes on it, but...

You should start making a plan to leave.
