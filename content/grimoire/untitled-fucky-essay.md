This is not an essay about fascism. Or maybe it is. You don't know. I don't know. We'll get there when we get there.

I don't smoke, much. Been thinking about it again. Only started for the worst job I've ever had, managed not to since, but fuck it, you know? World's burning around us. A cigarette once in a while won't kill me any faster than the Gestapo-Nouveaux. 

...okay, so maybe this *is* an essay about fascism. Hard not to be, really, in the here and now. Everything's about it right now, in the words or in the silence. You feel it too, right? Everyone just killing time. Sometimes I wake up and I go "I can't think about it today," and I try to distract myself, and that distraction is inevitably in the exact shape of *everything else.*

I talked, in [Strategy for the Dying Future(/tactics/000)], about how there was no world where we lose, and I was lying. At the time, it was more important to me to convey *hope* than *urgency,* because most everyone around me was talking about how the world was doomed, how there was no way we survive, and how there were Nazis in the streets. I still think there's merit, to that essay, but...

I'm a realist. I know, for a fact, that shit is going to get *drastically* worse before it gets better. And I still hope! But I see so, so many people, even and especially transgender people in the US, choosing to ignore the situation *until* the point of no return.

Have you set a point of no return?

Do you know how far past it we are?

This is the dying future. Politicians steadfastly refuse to do anything but kill more people. Journalists do little--there's some independent reporting, but major outlets have been defanged. I highly doubt there'll be a peaceful transfer of power in the US in 2028, but even *if there is,* and it's to someone blue instead of red, they may be *better,* but I know without a shadow of a doubt that won't matter to the friends of mine who die before then, the friends of mine who they refuse to do anything to protect.

I'm going to explicitly state I'm not advocating for violence, or bombs, or anything of the sort. I don't think a Molotov in the US in 2026 is going to get you anything but at best life in prison and an increased crackdown on anyone who they can say is Like You. Any crimes done by anyone even vaguely on the left are going to be infinitely more dangerous than those same crimes perpetrated by the right. Even being associated with antifascist action right now means they can say you're part of a terrorist group. Even being associated with transgender folk right now means they can say you're part of a terrorist group.  

I'm not saying *roll over and do nothing,* they're trying to kill you. It doesn't get you brownie points, and it doesn't make them *not trying to kill you.* That means: organize. Build community. Don't go getting yourself or your loved ones put in a forever box, be it a coffin or a cell.
