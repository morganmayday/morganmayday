  <p>to start, you need to understand that there is a lot that i literally cannot communicate here. i am not capable of it. i&rsquo;ve tried, and will try again.</p>
<p>(It exhales.)</p>
<p>we are still&hellip;<em>i.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a shit way to put it.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m aware of that. it&rsquo;s like&hellip;seasons, we used to describe it as.</p>
<p>States of matter.</p>
<p>yeah. that&rsquo;s a better way to do it. ice is still water. steam is still water.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really get the full picture. (she smiles.) Am I, for once, the one better at describing this?</p>
<p>&hellip;maybe. go for it.</p>
<p>(she leans forwards. there&rsquo;s a thing her face does, this intensity she channels when she&rsquo;s focused. it&rsquo;s beautiful.)</p>
<p>Every human being is a collection of self-agents tied together, running on hardware optimized to do two things: fuck, and die.</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s trying not to laugh but it fucking knows I&rsquo;m right. I clear my throat and keep going.)</p>
<p>Most of the time, it&rsquo;s most convenient for that human to have one self-aggregate, one model of <em>who they are.</em> Most people do have some awareness that there&rsquo;s not <em>just</em> one mim in there&ndash;&ldquo;drunk me&rdquo;, &ldquo;my inner child&rdquo;, et cetera&ndash;but this is largely ignored by polite society.</p>
<p>Plural systems tend to be&hellip;<em>more</em> fragmented. They&rsquo;re aware that they have self-agents, but most&ndash;and clarification, i&rsquo;m generalizing here&ndash;most disordered systems have <em>multiple</em> self-aggregates, that taken holistically are one self-aggregate-aggregate of, often, clashing and contradictory pieces of self.</p>
<p>We do not work either of these ways. They both have&hellip;advantages (not so much venom as grudging best-fit) and disadvantages. So does the way we work, but for us, the disadvantages are markedly fewer and further between, and the advantages are massive.</p>
<p>We are&hellip;let&rsquo;s call it <em>fluid.</em> We are a system with a singular self-aggregate. There is one Morgan Mayday. We are facets of that whole, fluid lenses from which to filter our contradictions into&hellip;(she rolls the words on her tongue for a moment before she settles) rather than <em>clashes,</em> a useful overlay. Rather than my analytical nature contesting her passion, or my intuition contesting his methodical surety, we have a stable harmony. Rather than a lack of understanding of the fluctuating nature of self, we have the ability to access <em>all of it.</em></p>
<p>&hellip;That all may sound&hellip;self-aggragandizing. We&rsquo;ve spent a while getting here. I think I&rsquo;ve earned it.</p>
<p>(she grins a little.)</p>
<p>So yeah. We don&rsquo;t like calling myself a system or a singlet.</p>
