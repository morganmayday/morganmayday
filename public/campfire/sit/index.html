  <p>tall evergreens, side by side with youthful all-but-saplings of less than a century, ground cover best described between &lsquo;rocky&rsquo; and &rsquo;nonexistent&rsquo;. the flame&rsquo;s burned down to barely more than coals, the woodsmoke long pervaded my skin. it&rsquo;s brisk, but i&rsquo;m not gonna bother with a jacket. i love the cold, you see.</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s one thing about me, it&rsquo;s that i can&rsquo;t resist telling a good story.</p>
<p>i have this theory, right, that there are two types of good communication: <em>evocation</em> and <em>explanation</em>. i like to evoke more than i like to explain, because if i&rsquo;ve done my job well, i&rsquo;ve evoked an explanation for you. show, don&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>She sits, beside me, and laughs a little at this. I know this, she says, and I love you. She doesn&rsquo;t feel the cold, not nearly as much as I do, but we both love it. Something about neurochemical balancing of nostalgia, she says, tells me that she doesn&rsquo;t know exactly why but that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;d guess, and i tell her she&rsquo;s explaining again.</p>
<p>She says that&rsquo;s her job. I can talk in riddles all I want, but she distills them, boils them down and cuts to the chase.</p>
<p>people hate her for it. she&rsquo;s blunt, too blunt; she does not care for the social rigamarole when she can just <em>tell you how she feels,</em> and be done with it. weasel-words are her enemy. if you fuck up, she&rsquo;ll tell you. she sees no use in niceties, thrives in the realm of efficiency, both linguistic and otherwise.</p>
<p>i say that&rsquo;s why we make such a good pair. i&rsquo;m a storyteller. neither of us can politic well, of course, but where simple words won&rsquo;t suffice&ndash;my pen, as her sword.</p>
<p>People hate it for that. Getting it to talk in a straight line is all but impossible. Try thinking with it, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself in a Gordian knot faster than you can say &ldquo;what the fuck are you even talking about&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I say that&rsquo;s why we make such a good pair. Her vision is three steps ahead of mine. I can get her to sit down long enough to cut that Gordian knot and execute on it.</p>
<p>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/morganmayday/about/blob/main/campfire/ask-it.md">ask me about her.</a></p>
<p>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/morganmayday/about/blob/main/campfire/ask-her.md">Ask me about it.</a></p>
<p>&gt; <a href="https://github.com/morganmayday/about/blob/main/campfire/explain-yourself.md">morgan, what the hell are you talking about?</a></p>
