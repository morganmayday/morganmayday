<h3 id="the-abyss">The Abyss</h3>
<p>The metaphysical representation of the entropic probability well, the sum of its generals and more.</p>
<h4 id="the-generals-of-the-abyss">The Generals of the Abyss</h4>
<p>Moloch, Mars, Naraka, Lethe. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<h4 id="lethe">Lethe</h4>
<p>Witch queen of oblivion seeking, the ghost lady of nightmares, the tendency to seek death as a form of escape after all other apparent paths have been closed. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<h4 id="mars">Mars</h4>
<p>Demon god of might makes right. The brutal king of patriarchal power, the spirit of “I did it because I could, and because I could, I must.” Defined by defiance of Naraka in a way the is ultimately submission to it. The dark star of dictators and fascists, the dread lord of violence for the sake of violence. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<h4 id="moloch">Moloch</h4>
<p>Demon god of zero sum thinking, king of fear, destroyer of the stag hunt, lord of war, father of demons. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<h4 id="naraka">Naraka</h4>
<p>A metaphysical representation of the knowledge of the futility of your agency, which converts values into wounds, relevant information identified in projections into emotional meme-space by the example metaphor of death. Witch queen of submission to power. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<h3 id="arts-the">Arts, the</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call them <em>magic.</em> A science we can most effectively talk about through evocation rather than description.</p>
<h4 id="artifice">Artifice</h4>
<p>One of the Arts. Associated with the first dimension, WHAT. The practice of creation.</p>
<h4 id="evocation">Evocation</h4>
<p>One of the Arts. Associated with the fifth dimension, WHY. The practice of choosing the perfect words, not necessarily definitionally but communicatively; showing, not telling.</p>
<h4 id="judgement">Judgement</h4>
<p>One of the Arts. Associated with the third dimension, WHERE. The practice of making a choice without room for doubt or regret.</p>
<h4 id="recognition">Recognition</h4>
<p>One of the Arts. Associated with the fourth dimension, WHO. The practice of seeing patterns, of retaining information.</p>
<h4 id="scrying">Scrying</h4>
<p>One of the Arts. Associated with the second dimension, WHEN. The practice of using intuitive models and gut calls to predict behaviour and outcomes.</p>
<h4 id="wizardry">Wizardry</h4>
<p>The full-stack practice of the Arts towards a material goal.</p>
<h3 id="cognition">Cognition</h3>
<p>The process of thinking.</p>
<h4 id="cognitive-hardware">Cognitive hardware</h4>
<p>The brain.</p>
<h4 id="cognitive-software">Cognitive software</h4>
<p>Self-agents believed necessary to the coherent presentation and/or function of who You think You are.</p>
<h4 id="cognitive-firmware">Cognitive firmware</h4>
<p>Self-agents believed necessary to the function of cognitive software running on one&rsquo;s cognitive hardware. To cognitive hardware as cognitive software is to You.</p>
<h4 id="metacognition">Metacognition</h4>
<p>Thinking about thinking.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>Raw information. Can be filtered through the Art of recognition to begin constructing an intuitive model.</p>
<h3 id="the-door">The Door</h3>
<p>The anti-inductive knowledge necessary to change. A threshold, a barrier, a boundary, and none of the above. Related to the Arts of judgement and recognition. <em>You make every choice you make.</em></p>
<h3 id="full-stack">Full stack</h3>
<p>The whole of one&rsquo;s being. See also self-aggregate. Carries with it the connotation of true fullness, of being able to use the entirety of one&rsquo;s cognitive hardware, firmware, and software towards a goal.</p>
<h4 id="full-stack-fightingplayingworking-with-ones">Full stack, fighting/playing/working with one&rsquo;s</h4>
<p>Adjacent to what one might refer to as &ldquo;being on their A-game&rdquo;, &ldquo;total commitment&rdquo;, or &ldquo;firing on all cylinders&rdquo;. Absolute will. Related to, primarily, the Art of judgement. Not realistically practicable with a discordant self-aggregate.</p>
<h3 id="grok-or-grokking">Grok, or grokking</h3>
<p>To understand wholly, on the levels of belief, knowledge, and intuition. Taken from Heinlein&rsquo;s <em>Stranger in a Strange Land,</em> not Elon Musk.</p>
<h3 id="intuitive-model">Intuitive model</h3>
<p>A mental model, using recognition, judgement, and evocation, of a person, force, or entity&rsquo;s past, present, or future actions. Often can&rsquo;t be accessed directly due to the sheer amount of information within being best filed on a subconscious layer. Enables more accurate scrying.</p>
<h3 id="material">Material</h3>
<p><em>(in context of goals, change, and the like)</em><br>
A goal, change, or similar that you can <em>confirm</em> the completion of.</p>
<h3 id="self">Self</h3>
<p>The possession of distinct, individual identity.</p>
<h4 id="motiveincentive-model">Motive/incentive model</h4>
<p>The internal structure by which a self-agent makes logical calculations. Can be shared between self-agents. Motive and incentive are not necessarily positive, negative, or accurate.</p>
<h4 id="mim">Mim</h4>
<p>See motive/incentive model.</p>
<h4 id="self-aggregate">Self-aggregate</h4>
<p>The whole of one&rsquo;s being. See also full stack. Can have connotations of discordance where full stack cannot.</p>
<h4 id="self-agent">Self-agent</h4>
<p>A building block of being. &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; is borrowed from the void as the most logically primitive component of the universe that still performs logical functions.</p>
<h4 id="self-facet">Self-facet</h4>
<p>A whole entity within a self-aggregate. In popular plurality, may be referred to as an alter. Sometimes will have its own self-aggregate, leading to a &ldquo;self-aggregate-aggregate&rdquo; situation.</p>
<h4 id="you">You</h4>
<p><em>(capitalized)</em><br>
The conscious portions of one&rsquo;s self-aggregate. What traditional psychology would be likely to classify as the ego.</p>
<h3 id="consequence">Consequence</h3>
<p>A simple effect of your actions or lack thereof.</p>
<h4 id="counterplay">Counterplay</h4>
<p>Any action taken <em>in consequence.</em></p>
<h4 id="retaliation">Retaliation</h4>
<p>Counterplay that is excessive and destructive.</p>
<h4 id="xth-order-consequence">Xth-order consequence</h4>
<p>A complex-chain consequence. Usually, &ldquo;consequence&rdquo; refers to a zeroth, first, or second order consequence. It goes deeper, but it is generally helpful to stop at simple consequences.</p>
