<p>Abyss, the: The metaphysical representation of the entropic probability well, the sum of its generals and more.</p>
<p>- Abyss, the Generals of the: Moloch, Mars, Naraka, Lethe. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<p>- - Lethe: Witch queen of oblivion seeking, the ghost lady of nightmares, the tendency to seek death as a form of escape after all other apparent paths have been closed. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<p>- - Mars: Demon god of might makes right. The brutal king of patriarchal power, the spirit of “I did it because I could, and because I could, I must.” Defined by defiance of Naraka in a way the is ultimately submission to it. The dark star of dictators and fascists, the dread lord of violence for the sake of violence. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<p>- - Moloch: Demon god of zero sum thinking, king of fear, destroyer of the stag hunt, lord of war, father of demons. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<p>- - Naraka: A metaphysical representation of the knowledge of the futility of your agency, which converts values into wounds, relevant information identified in projections into emotional meme-space by the example metaphor of death. Witch queen of submission to power. (Borrowed from the void.)</p>
<p>Arts, the: Let&rsquo;s call them <em>magic.</em> A science we only really understand through intuition and evoking around exactly how it works.</p>
<p>- Artifice: One of the Arts. Associated with the first dimension, WHAT. The practice of creation.</p>
<p>- Evocation: One of the Arts. Associated with the fifth dimension, WHY. The practice of choosing the perfect words, not necessarily definitionally but communicatively; showing, not telling.</p>
<p>- Judgement: One of the Arts. Associated with the third dimension, WHERE. The practice of making a choice without room for doubt or regret.</p>
<p>- Recognition: One of the Arts. Associated with the fourth dimension, WHO. The practice of seeing patterns, of retaining information.</p>
<p>- Scrying: One of the Arts. Associated with the second dimension, WHEN. The practice of using intuitive models and gut calls to predict behaviour and outcomes.</p>
<p>- Wizardry: The full-stack practice of the Arts towards a material goal.</p>
<p>Cognitive hardware: The brain.</p>
<p>- Cognitive software: Self-agents believed necessary to the coherent presentation and/or function of who You think You are.</p>
<p>- Cognitive firmware: Self-agents believed necessary to the function of cognitive software running on one&rsquo;s cognitive hardware. To cognitive hardware as cognitive software is to You.</p>
<p>Data: Raw information. Can be filtered through the Art of recognition to begin constructing an intuitive model.</p>
<p>Door, the: The anti-inductive knowledge necessary to change. A threshold, a barrier, a boundary, and none of the above. Related to the Arts of judgement and recognition.</p>
<p>Dimensions, first through fifth: See <a href="https://github.com/morganmayday/about/blob/main/grimoire/dimensions.md">here</a>. Page&rsquo;ll be refined and moved here at a later date.</p>
<p>Full stack: The whole of one&rsquo;s being. See also self-aggregate. Carries with it the connotation of true fullness, of being able to use the entirety of one&rsquo;s cognitive hardware, firmware, and software towards a goal.</p>
<p>- Full stack, fighting/playing/working with one&rsquo;s: Adjacent to what one might refer to as &ldquo;being on their A-game&rdquo;, &ldquo;total commitment&rdquo;, or &ldquo;firing on all cylinders&rdquo;. Total will. Related to, primarily, the Art of judgement. Not realistically practicable with a discordant self-aggregate.</p>
<p>Intuitive model: A mental model, using recognition, judgement, and evocation, of a person, force, or entity&rsquo;s past, present, or future actions. Often can&rsquo;t be accessed directly due to the sheer amount of information within being best filed on a subconscious layer. Enables more accurate scrying.</p>
<p>Material, in context of goals, change, and the like: A goal, change, or similar that you can <em>confirm</em> the completion of.</p>
<p>Self: The possession of distinct, individual identity.</p>
<p>- Motive/incentive model: The internal structure by which a self-agent makes logical calculations. Can be shared between self-agents. Motive and incentive are not necessarily positive, negative, or accurate.</p>
<p>- Mim: See motive/incentive model.</p>
<p>- Self-aggregate: The whole of one&rsquo;s being. See also full stack. Can have connotations of discordance where full stack cannot.</p>
<p>- Self-agent: A building block of being. &ldquo;Agent&rdquo; is borrowed from the void as the most logically primitive component of the universe that still performs logical functions.</p>
<p>- Self-facet: A whole entity within a self-aggregate. In popular plurality, may be referred to as an alter. Sometimes will have its own self-aggregate, leading to a &ldquo;self-aggregate-aggregate&rdquo; situation.</p>
<p>- You, capitalized: The conscious portions of one&rsquo;s self-aggregate. What traditional psychology would be likely to classify as the ego.</p>
