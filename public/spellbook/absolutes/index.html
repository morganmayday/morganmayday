  <p>Begin with the knowledge that I am not lying, and the knowledge that I am not telling the truth.</p>
<p>The Unsea is described, charted, navigated differently by everything that touches it. There are patterns, of course, shared terms and methods; the Unsea as a name is, itself, a part of the Unsea. Any lie that has ever been told is in there. Any truth that has been is, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>space is unhelpful in this sense, just as Truth is unhelpful in some respects. how do you look at your actual trajectory in the void when a fixed point is in some sense a meaningless concept? there’s nowhere to anchor your vision. okay, then- pick the closest sufficiently-massive idea and center the universe there. for you that’s going to be Consensus.</p>
<p>robin &amp; sath, <em><a href="https://dark-fireside.xyz/posts/the-unsea-and-ideogravity/">the unsea and ideogravity, learning to fly</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing here is that in this vast unplace, anything you don&rsquo;t look closely enough at&ndash;as long as it doesn&rsquo;t move too hard, with your frame locked onto that sufficiently-massive idea&ndash;can be an Absolute. That doesn&rsquo;t make it Cosmically Absolute, but it makes it one to you. robin and sath touch on the idea of the center of ideogravity&ndash;I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>
<p>A question everyone I&rsquo;ve talked about to this while they were early on in thinking about this stuff has had is &ldquo;well, how do we know anything is true, then?&rdquo; That doesn&rsquo;t matter. Things are true so long as you think they are. Ceci n&rsquo;est pas une pipe&ndash;as long as you <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s a pipe, it&rsquo;s a pipe. There is no difference until you give it one; there has been a difference the entire time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you hear what I&rsquo;m saying?<br>
If you <em>do</em>, have your <em>ears</em> checked, because no one said a word.</p>
<p>Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics, page 25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where delusion roots; the shifting of your frame, the concealing of information. Even if you objectively have that information&ndash;even if I have the data that I am safe, a paranoid delusion <em>conceals</em> that, occludes it. This is why you can come back from one: that information still exists.</p>
<p>All the Unsea orbits the center of ideogravity. There <em>is</em> a center&ndash;not an objective truth, perhaps, not an absolute, but something that will always stay in the center of the Unsea. This is a lodestar, if you can find it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no matter how eccentric you make your orbit, this can bring you back. become a comet, a shooting star.</p>
