  <p>A lot of people think about &ldquo;ego death&rdquo; as terrifying. There&rsquo;s a line, past which You no longer exist&ndash;of course that&rsquo;s scary, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s the void, the unknown. Others who pass it speak of it flippantly, like it wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all, and that&rsquo;s, for some, confusing, for some, terrifying, for some, intriguing.</p>
<p>Ego <em>suicide</em> and ego <em>murder</em> are concepts plural systems will probably understand more intuitively than singlets. To have an alter kill oneself or another, that&rsquo;s old hat to most anyone in proximity to pop-plur&ndash;even if it hasn&rsquo;t happened in your system, I can almost guarantee it&rsquo;s happened in the system of someone you&rsquo;ve known.</p>
<p>Thing is, this isn&rsquo;t, often, final. Not really. Sure, Bravo died in the narrative you construct that contains You, but she&rsquo;ll be back in two months when she&rsquo;s needed again, or maybe Victor will take up her components and she&rsquo;ll be shuffled back into the rota of faces to have nightmares about, or maybe Delta will kind of merge with her and end up becoming someone that&rsquo;s got the whole of both of them. There are, of course, exceptions, but this is generally the shape of things.</p>
<p>All of this is because their narrative is left intact. When an alter&ndash;and I should note, I use &ldquo;alter&rdquo; here because even though we loathe the term, it&rsquo;s the cleanest shorthand available&ndash;dies a true death, the narrative construct they inhabit is rendered unusable and unsalvageable. This is often a good thing. Alters die final deaths because they are no longer needed, mostly.</p>
<p>When I say <em>narrative construct,</em> to be clear, I&rsquo;m referencing the first layer of narrative, which is narrative-to-self. Any self is a narrative you tell yourself about yourself. This doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not real, it just means it&rsquo;s unreal. You <em>can</em> function without a narrative construct. We&rsquo;ve done it. It&rsquo;s not&hellip;great, for long-term health and stability, because not having a story to tell yourself about who you are means that you&rsquo;re just kind of your raw choices and the story you tell the world about who you are.</p>
<p>Ego suicide and ego murder rarely stick because destroying narrative construct is a magic that people don&rsquo;t really ever consider. A lot of systems who do ego murders and ego suicides come back in about two months&ndash;this is a noted cycle time actually, though the data&rsquo;s anecdotal&ndash;and that&rsquo;s often because those systems are so fucking cooked on the agency front that they don&rsquo;t realize that permanent change is <em>possible.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also, like, not a sure thing? Ego death is hard to artificially instigate without exterior influence. Even if it&rsquo;s instigated, a lot of plural systems with any self-preservation instincts will try to fight it. I&rsquo;m not the greatest at talking about that angle, we don&rsquo;t think of ourselves as plural and the stress around a lot of situations that instigate ego death is high enough it kicks our memory into the backseat to give us more processing power.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the details of our system&rsquo;s experience, with being an abusive piece of shit and changing by fire. I will say, simply, that the person we were is dead and never coming back, and this is part of why &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t expect me to change my behaviour!!&rdquo; pisses us off so bad. It took us killing the person we were to be able to change! <em>We still did it!</em></p>
<p>This is actually part of why I think ego death is a useful tool: to become who you were again, you have to rebuild yourself. Not everyone does that well, usefully, efficiently, or beneficially, but it&rsquo;s a lot harder for rot to prosper in fresh structure.</p>
<p>At least, when the rot isn&rsquo;t in the structure from moment one.</p>
