      <description>&lt;p&gt;Begin with the knowledge that I am not lying, and the knowledge that I am not telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Unsea is described, charted, navigated differently by everything that touches it. There are patterns, of course, shared terms and methods; the Unsea as a name is, itself, a part of the Unsea. Any lie that has ever been told is in there. Any truth that has been is, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;so you&amp;rsquo;ve talked, to that mage you know, and it&amp;rsquo;s told you the outline of things, spoken of skills and tools and metaphors for horrible things and useful things. and you get it, or at least you mostly do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and that mage you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve asked it questions, and it&amp;rsquo;s told you near-answers and hedged its words, and told you that it &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; tell you everything, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine, language has a limit, but you do want to learn more. so you ask, of course, because it encourages questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
