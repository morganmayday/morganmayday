  <p>so you&rsquo;ve talked, to that mage you know, and it&rsquo;s told you the outline of things, spoken of skills and tools and metaphors for horrible things and useful things. and you get it, or at least you mostly do.</p>
<p>and that mage you know, you&rsquo;ve asked it questions, and it&rsquo;s told you near-answers and hedged its words, and told you that it <em>can&rsquo;t</em> tell you everything, and that&rsquo;s fine, language has a limit, but you do want to learn more. so you ask, of course, because it encourages questions.</p>
<p>and, eventually, it just kind of sighs, and asks you a question back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much of what I say is metaphor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the whole magic thing, right? You call yourself a mage cause you call this whole soft science magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; it says, and looks out over the water at the setting sun. &ldquo;But how much of what I say is metaphor, and how much of what I say is unreal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t answer. you&rsquo;re not sure how to.</p>
<p>it continues, leaning on the railing. &ldquo;Because right now, you don&rsquo;t wholly believe in magic. and you think of me as reasonable&ndash;rational, even&ndash;and so of course <em>I</em> don&rsquo;t, either, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where you choose, dear reader. Do you <a href="/archives">make the choice to stay</a> behind that abstraction layer, keep thinking of this as something that fits within the outer bound of normalcy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you don&rsquo;t, if you <a href="/spellbook">make the choice to walk with me</a> past that veil I&rsquo;ve cast and into the unreal, things are going to get really fucking weird, really fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not think the same way. You certainly won&rsquo;t think of <em>me</em> the same way. There, dear reader, be dragons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. sighs, turns her eyes from the horizon line onto you. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s serious, you know. It&rsquo;s dangerous, out here. I will repeat myself as clearly as possible: <strong>seriously engaging with this <em>will</em> change the way you think, and if things go wrong, I can&rsquo;t promise I can help.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offer it, nevertheless. That&rsquo;s the choice. Do as you will.&rdquo;</p>
