  <p>This is a guest essay by our sibling Lūx!</p>
<hr>
<p>People take &ldquo;you can do whatever you want&rdquo; the wrong way a lot. I know I did, when I first heard it, even when I heard the first explanation for it. There&rsquo;s a part of us that gets <em>stubborn</em> about it, that rebukes the idea of &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; as <em>anything:</em> it is physically impossible to fly, for example. It is physically impossible to breathe underwater. It is physically impossible to alter my shape with pure will.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what that means, not really.</p>
<p>Some things are better served by the framing &ldquo;I can do anything I want, <em>once.&rdquo;</em> I <em>can</em> breathe underwater; once, before water floods my lungs. I <em>can</em> float in the air; once, before gravity takes me. In this case, it&rsquo;s more of a cost benefit analysis: I <em>can</em> do this, but is it worth the physical, emotional, or social repercussions?</p>
<p>Other things are better served by the framing &ldquo;I can do anything I want, <em>with help.&rdquo;</em> I cannot physically alter my shape; without a plastic surgeon. I cannot physically fly; without a hang-glider. I cannot physically breathe underwater; without an oxygen tank.</p>
<p>Yes, some things are physically out of reach. <em>For now.</em> This does not make them impossible, necessarily: it merely means more work. If you are like we were, you will dig in your heels at this assertion.</p>
<p>We did the same. We once took <em>you can do whatever you want forever</em> as something to silently scoff at; <em>not everything,</em> we would amend to ourselves, <em>some things are physically impossible, whatever you dream of.</em></p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is, if you want it, evaluate it. If you want it, work for it. If you want it, you cannot merely dream about taking it.</p>
<p>This applies to the mind as much as the body.</p>
<p><em>I wish I wasn&rsquo;t so scared.</em> You can do whatever you want forever. This doesn&rsquo;t make it easy. This doesn&rsquo;t mean imagining it so and it instantly solving itself. This means <em>work.</em> This means looking at yourself, and asking: why am I scared? It means identifying the issue, acknowledging the issue, and sitting with it without being consumed by it. It means talking to others and seeking help. It means backsliding, and setbacks, and putting yourself out of your comfort zone.\
You may look at that and decide it&rsquo;s not worth the emotional effort.<br>
This doesn&rsquo;t mean you <em>can&rsquo;t.</em> It merely means the pain of doing so is not worth it to you.</p>
<p>By this point, if you&rsquo;re like we were, you&rsquo;ve already dismissed us or gotten upset at the implications. How dare we say you&rsquo;re not trying? Don&rsquo;t we know how hard you&rsquo;ve tried? You <em>have</em> tried! You&rsquo;ve <em>been</em> trying!</p>
<p>Yes, you have been. But there&rsquo;s one more caveat we haven&rsquo;t addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do anything I want, <em>if I&rsquo;m willing to change my base assumptions.&rdquo;</em> This is the really big caveat for changes of the mind, the one that most people don&rsquo;t like to look at, the one that&rsquo;s big and scary and uncomfortable. It means actively shaking up things you&rsquo;ve held for a long time, re-examining them, asking <em>why</em> you think like that, asking if thinking like that is <em>useful</em> to you. And that&rsquo;s hard. That&rsquo;s scary. That&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A lot of people decide—more often subconsciously than not—that the stress, discomfort, and effort of uprooting their worldview isn&rsquo;t worth the payoff. Better to be comfortably scared than uncomfortably growing.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you want. Sometimes that means you choose not to grow. We make that choice sometimes. It is your life, and you can do whatever you want forever; that includes choosing <em>not</em> to change.</p>
<p>But you can.<br>
It&rsquo;s important that you know that you <em>can.</em></p>
<p>If you feel threatened by that, you have a choice now. You can examine <em>why</em> you feel threatened by that. What makes you upset. You can choose to look at it differently, choose to consider it seriously, <em>choose</em> to consider what it says about you.</p>
<p>Or you can choose not to examine it at all, and remain in the comfort zone where I don&rsquo;t understand anything about your feelings.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you want, forever.</p>
