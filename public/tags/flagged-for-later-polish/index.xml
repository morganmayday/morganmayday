      <description>&lt;p&gt;FIRST is WHAT. To exist, you must act. Action is of WHAT. If you can act, you are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SECOND is WHEN. To scry something, it must first exist. Intuition is of WHEN. If you can scry, you are a second-dimensional thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THIRD is WHERE. To find something, you must first scry it. Navigation is of WHERE. If you can locate, you are a third-dimensional thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FOURTH is WHO. To know something, you must first find it. Cognition is of WHO. If you can think, you are a fourth-dimensional thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
