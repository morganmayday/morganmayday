<p>Search. if not a person, then what?</p>
<p>you could go the route of the dolls. could disavow personhood, crunch down on your agency, be an object acted upon, rather than an actor in your own right. you could be a tool, an implement, something in service of another. it&rsquo;d be safer, easier, comfier, being provided for like that and providing in turn, as required of you. you wouldn&rsquo;t even have to be a person. someone else can do the heavy bit. you can interface with Consensus with an intermediary, rather than direct.</p>
<p>Identify. is that what you&rsquo;re looking for?</p>
<p>to be sure, you can&rsquo;t just <em>absolve yourself</em> of the personhood racket. there are underlying mechanisms, biases, things that will pervade until you unlearn them. you&rsquo;ve been serving it your entire life. do you want to serve something else? do you want that something else to be something external?</p>
<p>head into your bathroom. lock the door. light a candle, or turn on your phone flashlight and set it on the counter.</p>
<p>Establish contact. look in the mirror. turn out all the lights. meet the eyes you see there.</p>
<p>speak your own name until it no longer sounds like a word, until those eyes in the mirror desync from your own.</p>
<p>what do you want to be? ask it. listen, when it answers.</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ask it what it <em>is</em>. it knows already, because you do, too.</p>
