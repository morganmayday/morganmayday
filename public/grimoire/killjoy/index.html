<p>There is a tendency to assign neutrality to the masculine form of words in English, mostly in slang&ndash;&ldquo;hey, man,&rdquo; &ldquo;hey, dude,&rdquo; &ldquo;king shit&rdquo;&ndash;though it shows up sometimes in general phrasing still, feminist pushes mostly have made things like &ldquo;fireman&rdquo; over &ldquo;firefighter&rdquo; obsolete. This is, overall, something most people do, and something most people find pretty harmless. A lot of people will go through their lives not thinking about it, or thinking about it a tiny bit at most.</p>
<p>This is indicative, on the whole, in a similar way to how things like &ldquo;girl math&rdquo; or &ldquo;girl dinner&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a girl&rdquo; are indicative. If you think about how &ldquo;girl math&rdquo; is used, it&rsquo;s as a devaluation. &ldquo;Girl dinner&rdquo; is the same. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a girl&rdquo; uses <em>just</em> as the qualifier. You could conceivably say &ldquo;girlboss&rdquo; has positive connotations, if you like bosses, or ignore the fact that &ldquo;girlboss&rdquo; is usually used to talk about a woman who&rsquo;s done something kinda fucked up, or ignore the fact that it&rsquo;s tacking on a feminine qualifier to a word in such a way that it assumes inherent masculinity of <em>boss</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, neutral-word attempts are clowned upon. I saw people attempt to start using &ldquo;folx,&rdquo; &ldquo;Latinx&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mx.,&rdquo; and the like, and there was consistent confusion and mockery over the X&rsquo;s&ndash;Mx. survived, because there was no competition in its niche. Others weren&rsquo;t so lucky. Some nonbinary-specific neutrals, such as &ldquo;joyfriend,&rdquo; do still see some use, but are generally rejected by nonbinary communities, as there are better neutral alternatives pre-existing. That&rsquo;s a regular pattern: sometimes, something <em>already exists,</em> and as such very few folk will adopt the designed neutral. Why adopt &ldquo;folx&rdquo; when &ldquo;folks&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have any gendered connotations in the first place? Who does it exclude?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pattern in who&rsquo;s socially allowed to respond poorly to soft misgendering like this. In trans-accepting circles, calling a transgender man &ldquo;girliepop&rdquo; is, rightfully, recognized as invalidating. Cisgender men also react <em>really poorly</em> to any perceived threats to their gender, and are encouraged to do so in every circle. If you call a cisgender man a girl, he&rsquo;s encouraged and obligated to take that as fighting words. Very few cisgender men, and ostensibly cisgender men, react well to the suggestion that they <em>might not be men,</em> because masculinity matters to them.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the coin, cisgender women are <em>discouraged</em> from reacting poorly to threats to their gender. A lot of lesbians who are ingratiated in majority-cis-male circles are considered &ldquo;one of the guys,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s considered a compliment. If a woman is in a group, and someone addresses the group as &ldquo;guys,&rdquo; pointing that out will be a Whole Thing, versus the inverse scenario, where it&rsquo;s considered normal. &ldquo;Guys, and Sarah,&rdquo; is irregular, versus &ldquo;Girls, and Jeff,&rdquo; which is normal.</p>
<p>Transgender women, in particular, are socially discouraged from reacting to threats to their gender. If I call a man &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s socially allowed to pick a fight with me over that&ndash;but if I call a transgender woman &ldquo;dude,&rdquo; that is normal, par for the course, and happens continually even in trans-accepting circles. If she asks me to stop doing that, she has to ride a thin line&ndash;either do it in public, and kill the vibe, or do it in private, and risk other people thinking it&rsquo;s acceptable. The safest option for her is to grin and bear it. You can see this too, if you look. Keep an eye out, and next time you see a tgirl publicly stand up for herself, watch as the temperature of the room drops, as chatter doesn&rsquo;t quite pick up the same again, even if everyone ostensibly responds well.</p>
<p>This is all rooted in how society treats masculinity and femininity. Even in 2026, after wave after wave of feminism, there&rsquo;s still a pretty clear assumed dichotomy. Masculine people are strong, and resilient, and persistent, and worthy. Feminine people are weaker, more emotional, more vulnerable, more unreliable. Sometimes this is swapped out for &ldquo;men&rdquo; and &ldquo;women,&rdquo; &ldquo;males&rdquo; and &ldquo;females,&rdquo; &ldquo;AMABs&rdquo; and &ldquo;AFABs,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s all really routed the same, just with some minor phrasing differences. So: what happens when someone willingly rejects that masculinity? Either they have to perform that femininity well enough to be considered Women, or they get <em>othered,</em> and the assumed femininity&ndash;why do you think so many transgender women struggle to stand up for themselves? If they don&rsquo;t play to that bleak picture of femininity-as-uselessness, they risk being socially&ndash;or physically&ndash;murdered, <em>especially</em> disabled trans women, <em>especially</em> trans women of color.</p>
<p>When you get <em>othered</em> for not fitting that picture of womanhood, for having a spine, people begin to treat you as neither a man nor a woman nor however they treat nonbinary folk. You lose your right to gender and become, in their eyes, just a <em>bitch.</em></p>
