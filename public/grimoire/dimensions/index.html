  <p>FIRST is WHAT. To exist, you must act. Action is of WHAT. If you can act, you are.</p>
<p>SECOND is WHEN. To scry something, it must first exist. Intuition is of WHEN. If you can scry, you are a second-dimensional thing.</p>
<p>THIRD is WHERE. To find something, you must first scry it. Navigation is of WHERE. If you can locate, you are a third-dimensional thing.</p>
<p>FOURTH is WHO. To know something, you must first find it. Cognition is of WHO. If you can think, you are a fourth-dimensional thing.</p>
<p>FIFTH is WHY. To pin something like a butterfly to a word, you must first know it. Language is of WHY. If you can communicate, you are a fifth-dimensional thing.</p>
<p>All things may have preference for one dimension or another, but exist across all five dimensions. Yes, the wall is communicating. It&rsquo;s communicating <em>barrier.</em> The wall is thinking, too, but that&rsquo;s another can of worms that I&rsquo;ll get to later.</p>
<p><em>Evocation</em> is the magic of the fifth dimension. It is the art of painting a picture in a single word.</p>
<p><em>Recognition</em> is the magic of the fourth dimension. It is the art of connecting the dots.</p>
<p><em>Judgement</em> is the magic of the third dimension. It is the art of making a choice.</p>
<p><em>Scrying</em> is the magic of the second dimension. It is an intuitive prediction, a gut call, a lucky guess, a good model. Foresight is best practiced with the knowledge it will fail at random.</p>
<p><em>Artifice</em> is the magic of the first dimension. It is the act of creation.</p>
