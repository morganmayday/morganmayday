      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-rest&#34;&gt;i: rest.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is what you have been taught. it is what you are learning. it is discovery, slow but sure, of the things inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;things happen, and you respond. those responses carry you onwards. you&amp;rsquo;ll always love the taste of rainwater in the air. that little scar above your eye will fade, later, but you&amp;rsquo;ll remember it, think even after it&amp;rsquo;s gone that you can still see the outline. you&amp;rsquo;ll remember the stories, always, the ones you tell about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With thanks to Ra, for talking about this in a way that changed my life, and morrigan, for introducing me to its work, amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://voidgoddess.org/2023/09/26/the-personhood-contract/&#34;&gt;Recommended reading here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personhood is a tool of violence used by Authority, a perpetual threat used to separate Desirables and Undesirables. When any Person considers a group or being Undesirable, they often decry that group or being as not a person, as subhuman, as no better than &lt;em&gt;animals.&lt;/em&gt; You can see this happening&amp;ndash;well, anywhere you look, really, but most definitely in USAmerican politics as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
