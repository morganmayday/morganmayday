      <description>&lt;p&gt;With thanks to Ra, for talking about this in a way that changed my life, and morrigan, for introducing me to its work, amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://voidgoddess.org/2023/09/26/the-personhood-contract/&#34;&gt;Recommended reading here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personhood is a tool of violence used by Authority, a perpetual threat used to separate Desirables and Undesirables. When any Person considers a group or being Undesirable, they often decry that group or being as not a person, as subhuman, as no better than &lt;em&gt;animals.&lt;/em&gt; You can see this happening&amp;ndash;well, anywhere you look, really, but most definitely in USAmerican politics as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this&amp;rdquo; is a very simple statement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where we have to do things we find unpleasant.\&#xA;I do not like brushing my teeth. I also have to brush my teeth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s worse, for a lot of folk in school or assignment-based workspaces. A lot of the time, you have to suffer through boring, routine, difficult but not challenging, or overly challenging tasks, and those &lt;em&gt;suck.&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t like doing them. They do not bring me joy; this is why I&amp;rsquo;m not currently planning on going back to college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
