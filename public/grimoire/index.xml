      <description>&lt;p&gt;this is notes. loose stuff. don&amp;rsquo;t try to find a beam in here, this is stream of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I talk about the gods, I am an atheist. But I am an artist too, and therefore a liar. Distrust everything I say. I am telling the truth. The only truth I can understand or express is, logically defined, a lie. Psychologically defined, a symbol. Aesthetically defined, a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand Of Darkness&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do As You Will</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lock in. Lock in. If you lock in, you can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Northernlion&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We say it a lot. &lt;em&gt;Do as you will.&lt;/em&gt; Some people interpret it as disapproval, which is a fascinating phenomenon to me. It&amp;rsquo;s not disapproval, not inherently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do we &lt;em&gt;mean,&lt;/em&gt; do as you will? It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Do, as in take action, as you, as in &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; who You are, will, as in the future and the force of will. When I say &amp;ldquo;do as you will,&amp;rdquo; you could interpret that as &amp;ldquo;you can do whatever you want forever,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re going to do what you&amp;rsquo;re going to do,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;do whatever you decide to do,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;do what you want to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Notes on Ego Death, Murder, &amp; Suicide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick note: these are loose notes assembled from our thoughts. This is significantly less refined than anything else we&amp;rsquo;ve written.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think about &amp;ldquo;ego death&amp;rdquo; as terrifying. There&amp;rsquo;s a line, past which You no longer exist&amp;ndash;of course that&amp;rsquo;s scary, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? It&amp;rsquo;s the void, the unknown. Others who pass it speak of it flippantly, like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad after all, and that&amp;rsquo;s, for some, confusing, for some, terrifying, for some, intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5, 10, and a Little Bit of Magic</title>
      <link>https://morganmay.day/grimoire/5n10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking, right, about writing a spotter&amp;rsquo;s guide to 5&amp;amp;10s for a while, and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really been &lt;em&gt;flowing,&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating, admittedly, but that&amp;rsquo;s a me problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I dig into my pancake, take a bite, gesture with my fork and swallow. So I was talking, last night, with my colleague, and the topic of writing in general came up, and I said something and then I realized this morning that it&amp;rsquo;d been where I&amp;rsquo;ve gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Oculis Apertis Somnia</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-rest&#34;&gt;i: rest.&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it is what you have been taught. it is what you are learning. it is discovery, slow but sure, of the things inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;things happen, and you respond. those responses carry you onwards. you&amp;rsquo;ll always love the taste of rainwater in the air. that little scar above your eye will fade, later, but you&amp;rsquo;ll remember it, think even after it&amp;rsquo;s gone that you can still see the outline. you&amp;rsquo;ll remember the stories, always, the ones you tell about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Not A Person</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With thanks to Ra, for talking about this in a way that changed my life, and morrigan, for introducing me to its work, amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://voidgoddess.org/2023/09/26/the-personhood-contract/&#34;&gt;Recommended reading here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personhood is a tool of violence used by Authority, a perpetual threat used to separate Desirables and Undesirables. When any Person considers a group or being Undesirable, they often decry that group or being as not a person, as subhuman, as no better than &lt;em&gt;animals.&lt;/em&gt; You can see this happening&amp;ndash;well, anywhere you look, really, but most definitely in USAmerican politics as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
