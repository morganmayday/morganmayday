<p>hey. can i tell you a secret?</p>
<p>i sprawl back on the couch, sigh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hated all of my writing, lately.</p>
<p>sure, there&rsquo;s some that i don&rsquo;t <em>hate</em> hate, a few monologues or prompters or vignettes for various things that I feel like are <em>fine,</em> y&rsquo;know? it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>I always feel like I can do <em>more.</em> do <em>better.</em> I see the shit Caroline writes, and I&rsquo;m always blown away. she wrote <a href="/grimoire/do-as-you-will">Do As You Will</a>. she&rsquo;s&ndash;clever, and incisive, and she never really lets the emotions boil over onto the page unless it <em>fits.</em> she&rsquo;s a talented fucking writer.</p>
<p>I can evoke a feeling. I can do that <em>real</em> well. It&rsquo;s my strength, in writing; I can communicate what I&rsquo;m <em>feeling</em> really really effectively. but it never feels&hellip;I am an artist and therefore a liar. I can tell you the truth of what I <em>feel,</em> but I can&rsquo;t conjure <em>exactly what I experience</em> or <em>the whole of the fact</em> into your head. and maybe that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing, that nobody ever can reach, but it always feels like failure.</p>
<p>and, sure, logically&ndash;<em>logically</em> i&rsquo;m decently good at this. <em>logically</em> evoking that feeling is a powerful thing to do. it&rsquo;s useful, it&rsquo;s a component of good writing, et cetera et cetera et cetera. but i look at the writing around me and go <em>wow.</em></p>
<p><em>maybe i just kinda suck.</em></p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t to say, &ldquo;oh, feel bad for me.&rdquo; this is to say this is&ndash;the back edge of perfectionism. yeah, it drives me forwards to make something <em>better,</em> at all times. yeah, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gotten me, continually, to become <em>more.</em> but at the back edge, i&rsquo;m not and can&rsquo;t be perfect. never will be. and i resent that. like sure i don&rsquo;t expect perfection of <em>others,</em> but it&rsquo;s&ndash;me. A. Morgan. I know, in my heart of hearts, that I can do anything if I choose to. i can&rsquo;t ask that of others, but i can ask it of myself.</p>
<p>i just usually miss the step where skills require practice.</p>
<p>i laugh, a little. i really, really don&rsquo;t like being bad at things. that&rsquo;s the perfectionism, baby! if i wanna get good at stuff, i have to be bad at it first. i have to keep reminding myself this&ndash;it ain&rsquo;t like i got good at <em>anything</em> overnight. every skill i&rsquo;ve had, i&rsquo;ve learned the long way round. i forget that often, cause like. i have 20k+ hours, <em>on average,</em> in a lot of the shit i&rsquo;m really good at. there&rsquo;s shit i have 50k+ in. and that&rsquo;s part of why the first learning always feels <em>painful.</em></p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been learning to sing.</p>
