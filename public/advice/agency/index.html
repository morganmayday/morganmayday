  <p>I&rsquo;m cracking the top of my can and sitting down next to you on the stormwall. Listen, honey, I tell you, and shift a bit to get comfortable, to explain this I&rsquo;m gonna have to get kinda metaphorical. If you&rsquo;re not in a brainspace for a weird conversation, now&rsquo;s not the time.</p>
<p>A lot of people consider manipulation a type of abuse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making someone act against their will,&rdquo; well, yes and no. If the magician nudges a card, makes you more likely to pick it when they say &ldquo;any card,&rdquo; is that abusive?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distinction to be made between manipulation and coercion. Manipulation is <em>essential to communication.</em> It&rsquo;s inherent in any communication, two-sided or otherwise. The goal of manipulation isn&rsquo;t to make someone act against their will, it&rsquo;s to make someone <em>act,</em> full stop. It can be as simple as a conversation or as fucktangular as a relationship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking out at the water. You&rsquo;re thinking about if you could leave without me noticing&ndash;of course you can. This isn&rsquo;t really a conversation. Ceci n&rsquo;est pas une pipe. You&rsquo;re free to put this down at any time. By framing it as a conversation, I manipulated you into a different kind of receptivity.</p>
<p>Is that a bad thing?<br>
No. That&rsquo;s how communication <em>works.</em> Honesty is a kind of manipulation. Manipulation can only work against you when it&rsquo;s either coercion in a hat or you&rsquo;re already against yourself.</p>
<p>What is agency, though? Well, it gets defined a lot of ways, but I think it&rsquo;s best illustrated with this:<br>
I have the ability to choose one thing over another, <em>including the values that lead me to make these choices.</em> Agency is the productive process of transmuting desire into action&ndash;into desire, as needed.</p>
<p>Coercion is harmful because it seeks to halt that process. If you put a gun to someone&rsquo;s head, that&rsquo;s going to stop their desires from transmuting into action. Sometimes, agentic force can outweigh coercive force&ndash;this is why folk like me are harder to blackmail, because asking <em>&ldquo;so what&rdquo;</em> can defang a lot of coercion. Where manipulation is sleight of hand, coercion is an active threat. &ldquo;Do this, <em>or else.</em>&rdquo; Someone coercing you seeks to overwrite your agency using a deeper desire, like remaining alive or having friends or your loved ones being safe, to get you to take the actions they want you to take.</p>
<p>Manipulation is neutral. It seeks to <em>invoke</em> agency, at its core. The stage magician offering you the cards is invoking your desire to see a magic trick to get you to take actions to facilitate that. They&rsquo;ve set it up so the path of least resistance, if you take a card, is the card they want. That&rsquo;s manipulation 101, babey!<br>
Manipulation works because of what I call <em>scrying,</em> the process of predicting someone&rsquo;s actions. Without coercion, manipulation cannot make you act against yourself, <em>unless you were already willing to do that.</em> A lot of people conflate the two, because they&rsquo;ve been coerced in subtler ways.</p>
<p>See, subtle coercion relies on this idea of coercion as all the time being gun-to-your-head. Really, the operative part of the coercion is <em>&ldquo;or else.&rdquo;</em> Get a job, or else you won&rsquo;t be able to eat or keep a roof over your head. Your money, or else your life. Stay with me tonight, or else I&rsquo;ll kill myself. All three of these are coercion. The &ldquo;or else&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to be spoken, the retaliation just has to be <em>understood.</em> Subtle coercion relies on it being understood as a <em>natural consequence,</em> not an active retaliative choice.</p>
<p>Got all that? Good. I&rsquo;m finishing my drink, pulling off the tab to turn over in my hand. Next part&rsquo;s going to be a bit heavier. If you&rsquo;re an abuse survivor, <em>caveat emptor.</em> I&rsquo;m gonna be talking about the mechanics of it.</p>
<p>Longrunning abuse relies on using coercion with&hellip;what I will distastefully call <em>vision.</em> Coercion in the moment doesn&rsquo;t really <em>care</em> that agency can transmute action into desire. Abuse, however, does. Abuse done&hellip;<em>&ldquo;well&rdquo;</em> will leave you perpetuating it <em>on yourself</em> ad infinitum. It seeks to break your motive/incentive model permanently, make those desires feed into the actions they want without them even having to put the gun to your head again. They can, of course, so often they will, whether or not you give them the excuse of resisting.</p>
<p>Once abuse has broken your motive/incentive model, manipulation is a trivial tool to use. I cannot manipulate someone into doing something they aren&rsquo;t willing to do in the first place&ndash;abuse changes what you&rsquo;re willing to do. The most visible correct step when you know your motive/incentive model is broken is not to trust it&ndash;but that leaves you vulnerable. If you don&rsquo;t have ideals, goals, <em>desires</em> that you trust, you&rsquo;ll be rudderless and unable to exert agency on a productive strategic level.</p>
<p>So: you rebuild it from first principles. The thing about abuse, right, is that it can never root out <em>everything forever.</em> It can only make you think it has.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy for you to say,&rdquo; and I interrupt.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, cause I&rsquo;ve been here before, on the other side of the door. You can build quite a good motive/incentive model from one statement, if you take it to its logical conclusions and beware 5&amp;10s. I chose &ldquo;I want a kinder world.&rdquo; Everything else I am follows from that. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m still hunting legacy code in my own head&ndash;but when I find it, I can look at the desire it stems from, trace it backwards, and ask <em>does this value a kinder world?</em> And if it doesn&rsquo;t, I mark it as counterproductive, and when it crops up, I can <em>choose not to act on it.</em> I am living proof that this <em>works.</em> The hardest part is starting and sticking to it, and that&rsquo;s why abuse perpetuates itself.</p>
<p>You can choose, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m headed back inside.</p>
