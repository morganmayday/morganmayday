  <p>Shoutout, as usual, to my colleague morrigan. Most of these thoughts were cohered with or to it last night.</p>

<p>I sigh. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I say, gesture as if I&rsquo;m indicating the puff of heat into the midnight air, &ldquo;you gotta promise not to get weird or attacked, yeah? Cause what I&rsquo;m about to say is&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ruminate, for a second. &ldquo;Not necessarily objective,&rdquo; I settle on, &ldquo;definitely not <em>nonjudgemental,</em> but.&rdquo; Shake my head. &ldquo;I judge because I think these are skills that can be learned. I have high standards. That&rsquo;s fine. If I approved of everything unconditionally, my <a href="/glossary#recognition">Recognition</a> would be at best an atrophied mess. If I disapprove, that&rsquo;s not a statement of &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t love you anymore&rsquo; or &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think your thoughts have value&rsquo; or &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re worthless&rsquo;. It just means I think you have room to grow. If you&rsquo;re gonna get weird or attacked about this, now&rsquo;s your chance to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;still here, then? Alright. Good.</p>
<p>The thing you&rsquo;ve got to understand is that when most people say &ldquo;taking a relationship seriously,&rdquo; they mean <em>emotional investment, shown with time, attention, and sacrifice.</em> A lot of healthier-end polyamorous circles junk the &lsquo;sacrifice&rsquo; part, which is better! That&rsquo;s a lot of better, actually. It&rsquo;s just not <em>good.</em></p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m not talking about sexual or romantic or alterous or queerplatonic or whatever. I&rsquo;m just talking about relationships in general.</p>
<p>There are three important components to a healthy and serious relationship: attention, mutual emotional investment, and good living models. I stab my shovel into the dirt so I can count off on my fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Attention</strong> is most closely facilitated by time and <a href="/glossary#bandwidth">bandwidth</a>. It is most effectively defined as &ldquo;expending bandwidth on someone and your relationship with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I generally sort attention loosely into low-substance and high-substance, and strongly prefer high-substance.<br>
A low-substance interaction is less attention, but takes more bandwidth proportionate to the attention it gives&ndash;I still have to pay the startup and shutdown costs on that task. As such, I only really do low-substance interaction when I am specifically seeking out a long and low-cost interaction&ndash;when I watch bad TV with some of my friends, that&rsquo;s low-substance, but because it goes for hours without me having to spend much more than the startup and shutdown costs, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll opt for when I&rsquo;m nearing the end of my band.<br>
A high-substance interaction is more attention. Often, this can be prohibitively expensive if you&rsquo;re low on band, but if I have budgeted my bandwidth well, this is going to <em>almost always</em> be my choice. I don&rsquo;t get to have this with everyone all the time&ndash;I don&rsquo;t have a lot of bandwidth spare, I have a <em>lot</em> of shit on the metaphorical stove and my time is tightly prioritized&ndash;but neither do I have the ability to give low-substance attention often, for the exact same reasons. For me, this looks like in-depth conversations about things that matter, mostly. While I guess it&rsquo;s technically attention, I don&rsquo;t consider gift-giving by default attention of either kind.</p>
<p>Not being able to give attention all the time&rsquo;s fine. I can&rsquo;t fuckin do it. Bandwidth&rsquo;s limited, we&rsquo;re all stuck in this human cognitive hardware, this is why I often don&rsquo;t reply to messages of semi-random affection, it&rsquo;s fine. The skill here is mostly knowing your limits, knowing when the attention juice is worth the bandwidth squeeze, and&ndash;well, I&rsquo;ll get back to that last thing, cause it ties into a later point.</p>
<p>There is another kind of attention, that you should be giving all the time, that I generally mean when I say &ldquo;paying attention&rdquo;&ndash;that&rsquo;s listening. That&rsquo;s how you get data. That&rsquo;s how your living models grow. I think I&rsquo;ll leave that at common understanding, for now. I clear my throat and tick off on my second finger.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional investment</strong> is most closely facilitated by whatever the fuck gives you warm and fuzzy feelings. <strong>Mutual emotional investment</strong> is most closely facilitated by time, attention, and good living models.</p>
<p>See, the thing with emotional investment is that you can feel all the warm and fuzzy feelings you want, but that doesn&rsquo;t put them in your relationship partner&rsquo;s head. They can have all the warm and fuzzy feelings they want, but that doesn&rsquo;t put them in your head. Emotional investment means absolutely nothing if not anchored in the <em>mutual</em> aspect&ndash;you have to communicate, and you have to be on the same page&ndash;and it means absolutely nothing without good living models. Attention is such a good facilitator because it builds, expresses, and develops this investment. The skill here is mostly recognizing that all emotional investment, on its own, is, is a motivating force. Mutual emotional investment is a useful motivating force because the <em>mutual</em> aspect requires you being on the same page.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to the part I mentioned in the title. I tick off on my third finger&ndash;<strong>living models.</strong> Specifically good ones&ndash;good models that stay good beyond a single situation are a subset of living models.</p>
<p>This was what inclined me to talk about this. There&rsquo;s this horrid isolation, you know, that comes from feeling like very few folk have good models of you. It&rsquo;s been one of my sticking points lately; I can count on one hand the number of folk who have a good enough model of me to tell the difference between me being upset, uncomfortable, and distressed <em>and</em> tell how to respond. That&rsquo;s&hellip;probably going to require its own essay.</p>
<p>The thing is, right, that I am a living entity. I grow, and I change, and the more a model is caught up in the image of me as I was&ndash;I gesture, frustrated. It feels like a lot of people have a painting of what they call me in their heads. Every time I grow, or change, or tell a secret, or open up, they decide either to paint it on top or to disregard. This leads to either a rotting image of who once possessed this body, a mess of paint caked on top of something that was once canvas, or, most often, both.</p>
<p>Some amount of modeling is always going to be predicated on past behaviour, that&rsquo;s how <a href="/glossary#recognition">Recognition</a> and <a href="/glossary#scrying">Scrying</a> <em>work.</em> That&rsquo;s fine. Your model will never be perfect, you aren&rsquo;t inside my skull. That&rsquo;s fine. A living model grows, is the thing. I don&rsquo;t have to consciously append shit, <em>almost ever,</em> because the model itself does that. I notice things, I pay attention, and I <em>ask questions.</em> The model does the rest. It gets to me, when this is not how others model me, because it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s the difference between simulacra and <em>reflection.</em> A living model of someone reflects everything they&rsquo;ve shown you without you needing to staple shit to it. A static model, conversely, is a simulacrum of who they have shown you, assembled piecemeal.</p>
<p>The skill here is&hellip;more complicated. You don&rsquo;t build a living model, you grow one. For a living model to be good, you have to be able to put yourself in their shoes, to recognize what they show you. For a living model to be excellent, you have to be able to <em>accurately, efficiently, and effectively</em> scry outwards from there. For attention to be effective, you have to be able to use that living model. For good mutual emotional investment, you have to have a good living model, and so do they. All else follows from <em>knowing who they are,</em> and that follows from understanding, which follows from listening. A static model can have data appended to it to get better&ndash;a living model <em>gets better with data.</em></p>
<p>This is, in the end, most of why my closest relationships are so close. We give each other attention. We have mutual emotional investment. We notice things, we pay attention, and we have good living models&ndash;even though my model of my partner may not be my best model, it&rsquo;s <em>alive,</em> and so is she, and I listen.</p>
<p>I exhale, pull my shovel out of the dirt, sling it over my shoulder. There&rsquo;s a fourth component, to a healthy and serious relationship, you know. It&rsquo;s trust. That follows from all else and more. You don&rsquo;t have to trust everyone about everything always, lights know I don&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m always going to be closer to someone the fewer caveats I can have on that trust.</p>
<p>If your models are static, you&rsquo;ll never really be able to accurately trust except by blind choice.</p>
