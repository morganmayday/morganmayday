      <description>&lt;p&gt;With thanks, deep and irrevocable, to morrigan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Required reading: &lt;a href=&#34;https://morganmay.day/grimoire/personhood&#34;&gt;Not A Person&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The nature of empathy and sympathy,&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;that I&amp;rsquo;ve met very few people who understand, is that they&amp;rsquo;re rarely-to-never going to be exactly right. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think of myself as having sympathy, because sympathy is &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; how others feel—I can guess, and I can guess very, very well; my models are generally &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt;, but I will never be physically inside someone else&amp;rsquo;s head. The mistake of sympathy and empathy is thinking you&amp;rsquo;re always right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emotions vs Reason, and Self Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Association with &lt;a href=&#34;https://morganmay.day/advice/desire&#34;&gt;To Desire&lt;/a&gt;, amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The register&amp;rdquo; will require its own whole grimoire page. The working definition for this piece is &amp;ldquo;a tool in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://morganmay.day/glossary#cognition&#34;&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; layer that logs cognition, allowing for better metacognition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minds, broadly, react to stimuli. The human animal reacts to stimuli in one way: thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this piece, &lt;em&gt;subconscious thought&lt;/em&gt; is any electrical impulse in the brain that results in consequence without being registered in what we call &lt;em&gt;the register.&lt;/em&gt; These most often will be things like ducking at a loud noise, yanking your hand away from a hot stove, or flinching from a blow&amp;ndash;sometimes, you will have them registered, but most of the time, the neuromuscular impulse happens without consulting you. These are things we would consider on the layer of &lt;a href=&#34;https://morganmay.day/glossary#cognition&#34;&gt;cognitive hardware&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;things that do not bother to be registered, because doing so wastes time that, evolutionarily, not wasting leads to a higher survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To Desire</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this&amp;rdquo; is a very simple statement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We live in a world where we have to do things we find unpleasant.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I do not like brushing my teeth. I also have to brush my teeth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s worse, for a lot of folk in school or assignment-based workspaces. A lot of the time, you have to suffer through boring, routine, difficult but not challenging, or overly challenging tasks, and those &lt;em&gt;suck.&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t like doing them. They do not bring me joy; this is why I&amp;rsquo;m not currently planning on going back to college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Apologise To Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edit 19 Nov 2025: Correction for the unapology, added by Caroline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Sorry&amp;rsquo; is all well and good, but what are you going to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; about it?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Let me explain. There are three kinds of apologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One: the &lt;em&gt;superficial apology&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Oop, sorry&amp;rdquo; is the most benign form of this, running into someone and apologising and moving on is, like, just a generally nice thing to do. However, a lot of people extrapolate this into a counterproductive form.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Generally, apologising for something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter just obligates the other conversational participants to comfort you. The more self-flagellating the apology, the worse this is, because it carries over into the way I approach other apologies from you in future. If you do something that&amp;rsquo;s, for lack of a better phrase, kinda sucks, I&amp;rsquo;ll point it out to you if I trust you not to self-flagellate about it and just to use the data. If you&amp;rsquo;ve done something that hurts or irritates me, the last thing I&amp;rsquo;m going to want is to have to comfort you out of a spiral. I&amp;rsquo;ll do it, because as a general rule I think that not doing it would be incompatible with who I want to be, but I will not be bringing data to you in future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agency, Manipulation, Coercion, and Abuse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m cracking the top of my can and sitting down next to you on the stormwall. Listen, honey, I tell you, and shift a bit to get comfortable, to explain this I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to get kinda metaphorical. If you&amp;rsquo;re not in a brainspace for a weird conversation, now&amp;rsquo;s not the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people consider manipulation a type of abuse. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re making someone act against their will,&amp;rdquo; well, yes and no. If the magician nudges a card, makes you more likely to pick it when they say &amp;ldquo;any card,&amp;rdquo; is that abusive?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
