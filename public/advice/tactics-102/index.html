  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t covered Tactics 101, you should probably go do that <a href="/articles/tactics-101">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is where things stop being as abstract. In the previous class, I talked about the basics of offense, defense, proactivity, and reactivity. I glossed over opsec and infosec, I quoted Sun Tzu and referenced Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about something different and start getting a little <em>concrete.</em><br>
See, today, I&rsquo;m starting with consequences and counterplay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consequence&rdquo; is a real loaded term, so let&rsquo;s define it: a simple effect of your actions or lack thereof. Let&rsquo;s say I slap you. For the sake of argument, it is nonconsensual and unprovoked.<br>
The first consequence of this is that you are physically hurt, considering I&rsquo;ve got a fairly good arm. The second consequence of this is likely that you feel emotionally hurt. The consequence of those consequences is that you, if you have self-respect, are going to take actions to counterplay me here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s define &ldquo;counterplay&rdquo;: in context, it is any action taken <em>in consequence.</em> In the same scenario, where I slapped you, being unwilling to be around me is consequence, and telling your friends I slapped you is counterplay. Good counterplay is going to prevent yourself and others from getting slapped by me again.</p>
<p>The line counterplay walks, though, is <em>retaliation.</em><br>
Be very, very fucking careful with it.<br>
The delineation is not one I can describe. You&rsquo;ve kind of got to hone an intuition on it, the best heuristic I can give is along the lines of &ldquo;if I acted this way to someone, and they responded the way I want to, would that be justified?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been on both sides of retaliation, and it sucks, actually.</p>
<p>Getting good at tactics involves building those intuitive models up. Everyone and their mother recommends chess, it&rsquo;s the classic strategy game, but truth is I&rsquo;ve never really liked chess, especially as a good tacsim. Hidden information is an essential thing in tactics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the best teacher is experience. Low-stakes things are going to be the way you can fail and learn with minimal consequences, but they&rsquo;re never going to teach you what it&rsquo;s like to win or lose with, well, stakes. I&rsquo;ve unfortunately had a lot of experience in higher stakes, due to having a hell of a messy life, and I cannot recommend it.</p>
<p>However! I can recommend, if you want to get good at tactics, Magic: the Gathering is a legitimately good way to learn game strategy once you have a handle on the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a high upfront time and sometimes money investment, but it helped. A better option is a good wargame or intrigue game with friends, ideally with a GM who is good at tactics and strategy&ndash;earlier D&amp;D/Pathfinder 1e and Lancer are good wargames for tactics and strategy, and while I want to shill my own intrigue game, I believe the best recommendation I&rsquo;ve seen on the market is likely going to be Blades in the Dark.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything else for you today. Class dismissed!</p>
