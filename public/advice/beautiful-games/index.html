  <p>The term &ldquo;beautiful game&rdquo; is&ndash;well, apparently, it&rsquo;s a nickname for association football/soccer. Didn&rsquo;t actually know that one, but it just showed up in preliminary research. Wild.</p>
<p>Where was I? Ah, yeah. The term &ldquo;beautiful game&rdquo; is something that might seem&hellip;kind of strange out of context, especially if you&rsquo;re used to it in the context of football. It gets more complicated outside of contexts with specific mastery&ndash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang">zugzwang</a> is beautiful, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush">hackenbush</a> is beautiful, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHHZHD0soQ">Gifts Ungiven in the hands of Frank Karsten</a> was beautiful back at Worlds 2005, all of these are fairly indisputable, but what do I <em>mean?</em></p>
<p>The objective of a beautiful game is to make something beautiful.</p>
<p>Morgan is an <em>avid</em> TTRPG player. Collectively, we have spent thousands upon thousands of hours playing, running, writing, and developing games. So what&rsquo;s a beautiful game, in the context of a TTRPG?</p>
<p>A beautiful game is more than the sum of its parts. It&rsquo;s a conversation, a story being told by the game. I&rsquo;m not talking something like &ldquo;we have a plot we&rsquo;re going down&rdquo;, either. It&rsquo;s&ndash;improv. Call and response, taking both seriously. A game as <em>art.</em></p>
<p>when I play with my colleague morrigan, there&rsquo;s something that happens. We&rsquo;re not&ndash;speculating, we&rsquo;re not plotting. I have loose beats plotted, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s a call and response, with mechanics as adjudicator. I&rsquo;m not the Spinner, the GM, the what-have-you, and morrigan&rsquo;s not the player&ndash;we&rsquo;re storytellers together, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just because we <em>choose</em> to do it. I mean, we do choose, agency&rsquo;s a wonderful thing, but we trust each other to play off of that. I think Morgan and mori have asked each other maybe one or two clarifying questions that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> about context. It makes sense&ndash;they&rsquo;re both really good at improv and modeling each other&rsquo;s intentions. They treat the game as a medium, not an obstacle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a good comparison to be made here. Brennan Lee Mulligan is the only D&amp;D5e DM we respect whatsoever, and it&rsquo;s because he is willing to make the game a <em>medium for art.</em> Most other DMs play around it, tell a plot and the players play through it using the system. Brennan Lee Mulligan tells <em>stories.</em></p>
<p>Not every player is looking to play a beautiful game, and a beautiful game can take a <em>lot</em> of energy. A lot of players, also, misidentify what&rsquo;s important: they favour plot and character, over the story. When Morgan is telling a story about the horrors of war and finding family under adversity, the plot isn&rsquo;t going to be &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the horrors of war, now find family under adversity&rdquo;. The characters aren&rsquo;t going to stay the image the players have in their heads at the start, and a lot of players forget that, too. As our plot and story adapt, so too must the character.</p>
<p>In a beautiful game, the players have to take initiative. If your character is going to be passive, if you&rsquo;re only going to think the things you&rsquo;ve written down about them, you&rsquo;re not going to find success. You have to correctly identify and match tone and flow, identify what the story is, to improvise <em>well,</em> but you don&rsquo;t get better by asking Morgan for clearance every time you have an original thought.<br>
We have our pet peeves&ndash;players trying to be mechanical arbiters, characters or things from other settings&ndash;for similar reasons. If you&rsquo;re trying to give yourself a penalty, someone rolling against you a bonus, instigating a check, or choosing to fail something, you should be looking for a feature that says you can. Bad games like 5e encourage the opposite, and that isn&rsquo;t playing within the medium, it&rsquo;s trying to force an outcome with tools the medium has. Characters and things from other settings <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> built for the medium, aren&rsquo;t built for the world, and come with baggage even if you think and say they don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ve got prebuilt assumptions, and those are between harmful to antithetical to playing beautifully.</p>
<p>Our best players, without exception, are brave, evocative, and riff off of us. They take context in account and build not in a vaccuum nor <em>only for specific context,</em> but play within the medium and world. They do things that make sense, and make sense we can make <em>more</em> with. I&rsquo;m not saying every player needs to be morrigan or Malady, but it makes our job easier.</p>
<p>We play TTRPGs in part because we love spending time with our friends, and in part because we&rsquo;re here to play a beautiful game. If we can&rsquo;t do both, we&rsquo;re not going to like it much.</p>
