<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p><a href="/advice/empathy">I&rsquo;ve detailed my reasons why</a>, but you may have your own! I won&rsquo;t waste time speculating.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been struggling to make the whole change at once, I <em>highly</em> recommend taking it in steps. Going vegetarian is way easier than going vegan, making it a really good stepping-stone.</p>
<h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going vegan, you gotta watch a couple things.</p>
<p>&ndash; B12&ndash;seaweed contains some, but a supplement is still basically required. I take one 5k mcg sublingual tablet 1-3 times a week and it seems to work.<br>
&ndash; Protein&ndash;protein. You need it. Tofu, beans, oats, nuts, and potatoes are all good towards getting enough protein.</p>
<p>There are other nutrients to keep an eye on&ndash;iron, calcium, and omega-3, off the top of my head, but a more detailed search and a knowledge of your own health will serve you better.</p>
<h3 id="nonvegan-ingredients">Nonvegan ingredients</h3>
<p>With almost anything, you can google whether it&rsquo;s vegan or not&ndash;some things even are labeled, but here&rsquo;s my short list I look for when buying food.</p>
<p>These are always nonvegan:<br>
&ndash; Dairy, meat, eggs, obviously<br>
&ndash; Shellac<br>
&ndash; Gelatin<br>
&ndash; Whey (is a milk product)<br>
&ndash; Honey<br>
&ndash; Lanolin (used in cereals for Vitamin D3 fortification)<br>
&ndash; Carmine/cochineal/red 4<br>
&ndash; Lard<br>
&ndash; Casein<br>
&ndash; Cysteine</p>
<p>These sometimes show up on package-certified vegan foods:<br>
&ndash; Non-organic, non-cane sugar is most often processed with bone char (in the US)<br>
&ndash; Mono-and-diglycerides<br>
&ndash; Pectin (fruit pectin is fine)<br>
&ndash; Lactic acid (can be plant-sourced)</p>
<h3 id="store-bought-ready-foods">Store-bought ready foods</h3>
<p>I fucking hate Whole Foods, but their 365 brand <em>does</em> clearly label their vegan products, and they do generally have a fairly robust alternative foods section. Amy&rsquo;s Vegan Margarita frozen pizza is the best vegan frozen pizza I&rsquo;ve ever had. Ben n Jerry&rsquo;s oat-based ice cream is vegan, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen. Morningstar Farms has some explicitly-labeled vegan foods&ndash;some of their foods are vegetarian instead, keep an eye out, I can personally recommend their corn dogs. I&rsquo;ve been recommended the Trader Joes&rsquo; vegan tikka masala, though I&rsquo;ve never tried it.</p>
<p>If you drink, I can say off the top of my head that Jinro soju and Kraken rum are vegan, but Kahlua and Fireball aren&rsquo;t. Check <a href="https://www.barnivore.com/">barnivore</a> for your drinks of choice.</p>
<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<p>These recipes assume you have a working stovetop. I haven&rsquo;t used a microwave in over a calendar year, so I don&rsquo;t have any microwave recipes; I&rsquo;ll indicate the oven recipes.</p>
<p>Some quick definitions, keeping in mind I am not very cooking-literate, these are just what I&rsquo;ve picked up:<br>
&ndash; A saucepan is a pot with a stick-out handle, usually also smaller.<br>
&ndash; A frying pan/skillet is the much flatter version, usually very short but much broader.<br>
&ndash; Low heat is the 1-2 setting on most stoves, medium-low heat is the 3-4 setting on most stoves, 5-6 is medium, 7-8 is medium-high, and 9-10 is high heat, usually. Stoves do vary, though.<br>
&ndash; A boil is when big bubbles are coming to the surface of a fluid. If in doubt, it&rsquo;s not boiling.</p>
<h3 id="low-effort">Low Effort</h3>
<p>These recipes can be done quickly and for very little energy. I generally lean here for breakfasts. Since these are really easy, I&rsquo;m not including recipes proper.</p>
<h4 id="toast">Toast</h4>
<p>You know how to make toast. Vegan butters are good, jam is good, and if you want protein, peanut butter helps. Garlic&rsquo;s also fucking fantastic.</p>
<h4 id="bagels">Bagels</h4>
<p>Bagels are really good, and a lot of them are naturally vegan. There are plant-based cream cheese alternatives, but peanut butter, jam, or vegan butter will serve you <em>excellently,</em> while I find plant-based cream cheeses vary significantly in quality.</p>
<h4 id="pbj">PB&amp;J</h4>
<p>PB&amp;J is a standby for a reason. If you toast the bread before spreading it, you get some good good crunch.</p>
<p>If you want a more sophisticated PB&amp;J, try frying the bread lightly in some seasoned vegan butter&ndash;parsley and oregano, some salt, about a third of a stick of butter over medium-low (3 on most stoves) heat. Flip it over about 4 minutes in, once it&rsquo;s browned on one side, and fry the other for a couple minutes as well. This takes a lot more effort, but it&rsquo;s worth it sometimes.</p>
<h3 id="medium-effort">Medium Effort</h3>
<p>These recipes usually take about 15 minutes with little prep time.</p>
<h4 id="oatmeal">Oatmeal</h4>
<p>0.5 cup oats, 1 cup water, pinch of salt, and brown sugar/maple syrup to taste<br>
Requires a saucepan or pot, and a stirring spoon.</p>
<ol>
<li>Salt and boil your water.\</li>
<li>Add the oats, then reduce to medium low heat.\</li>
<li>Cook and stir for about 12 minutes.\</li>
<li>Remove from heat and let stand for about 2 minutes.\</li>
<li>Stir in unrefined/organic brown sugar to taste before serving. Same with maple syrup, though less is generally more there.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pasta">Pasta</h4>
<p>Box of pasta, dash of salt, and butter/sauce to taste<br>
Requires a saucepan or pot, and a stirring spoon. A colander helps.</p>
<p>Check your box directions, and follow them. Usually, this is:\</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill your saucepan mostly with water. Drop in a dash (a small amount, usually an overflowing pinch) of salt, and stir lightly for like 10 seconds while you set the heat to high.\</li>
<li>Once your water is boiling, dump in your pasta and wait about 8-15 minutes, depending on variety. Turn your heat down to medium-high.\</li>
<li>Make sure the water doesn&rsquo;t boil over&ndash;if it does, take it off the heat for a second til it stops rising and goes back down to just a boil. If you have an electric, not gas, stove, you can put a wooden spoon over the top and it&rsquo;ll delay the boil-over slightly, but it is more of a fire hazard on a gas stove.\</li>
<li>Once your timer is up, drain the pasta. You can do this in a colander, though I just pour out the water using the spoon to stop the pasta from coming past, which takes a bit more finesse but doesn&rsquo;t require a colander.\</li>
<li>Melt a bit of butter, to taste, in the still-hot saucepan, and stir with the pasta before serving.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="high-effort">High Effort</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged by the name! These recipes are all worth the time and energy, they just take at least 30min including prep time.</p>
<h4 id="pancakes">Pancakes</h4>
<p>1.5 cup flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 0.5 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp granulated sugar, 1 cup alternative milk, 0.5 cup water, up to 2 tbsp canola oil<br>
Requires a whisk (or spoon but it&rsquo;s worse), stirring spoon, spatula, mixing bowl, large skillet or griddle, and optionally a ladle</p>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. (You can even bag this mix and use it later.)\</li>
<li>Pour the milk, water, and oil in, stir until just combined (a few lumps are fine, don&rsquo;t worry about getting it smooth as sharks.)\</li>
<li>Grease the skillet (cooking spray works, butter likely works too), then heat over medium-high heat.\</li>
<li>Drop about a third of a cup of batter onto it. Cook until it begins to bubble, then flip it and cook until golden brown, which is about 1-2 minutes usually.\</li>
<li>Serve hot, or freeze and eat through the week.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="fries">&ldquo;Fries&rdquo;</h4>
<p>A good-sized russet potato (or two or three smaller ones), about 0.5 to 2/3 cup olive oil (extra virgin recommended), black pepper, onion powder, salt, garlic powder (or a little garlic oil substituted for some of the olive oil)<br>
Requires a cutting board, kitchen knife, saucepan, and spoon or spatula. A potato peeler is optional, but can make your life way easier. I recommend having somewhere to put the oil as well&ndash;don&rsquo;t just pour it down the drain after you&rsquo;re done. An empty glass pasta sauce jar works well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your potatoes thoroughly, then peel them. If there&rsquo;s a bit that looks bad on the potato, just cut it out.\</li>
<li>Chop your peeled potatoes into bite-sized chunks&ndash;a good rule of thumb is square chunks a little shorter than your thumb from tip to first joint.\</li>
<li>Pour the oil into the saucepan, then season it. Measure with your heart. If you can&rsquo;t do that, do about half a tablespoon of onion powder, about a teaspoon of salt, and about a teaspoon of black pepper. Stir it a bit, and put the oil on low heat.\</li>
<li>Drop in the potatoes. Be careful of oil splashing. Toss them a bit in the pan to coat all of them in the oil.\</li>
<li>Cook your potatoes, stirring continuously, for about 15 minutes on low heat until they&rsquo;ve started to soften (you can check by poking them, if they split a little when you stab em lightly with a knife like you&rsquo;re trying to pick them up, you&rsquo;ve cooked them enough.)\</li>
<li>Fry your potatoes for a couple minutes (3-5ish), turning up the heat to medium-low.\</li>
<li>Serve hot, fresh, and with ketchup.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="garlic-bread">Garlic bread</h4>
<p>Bread (either sliced sourdough, or a baguette/loaf cut in half), 0.5 cup unsalted vegan butter, as much garlic as your heart desires (I recommend like a normal-sized bulb, or substitute 3 tbsp of garlic powder), 2 tbsp parsley, pinch of black pepper, two pinches of salt<br>
Requires a baking sheet, oven, bowl of any kind, mixing bowl, and kitchen knife.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set out the butter to soften, and preheat the oven to 375F/190C. (You can soften the butter with light microwaving if you want, you just don&rsquo;t want to melt it.)\</li>
<li>Peel the garlic, then crush it under the flat of your knife against the counter or cutting board (put all your weight on it til you feel it <em>crunch</em>), then chop it up as small as you can get it.\</li>
<li>Mix and mash the ingredients into a paste in the bowl, then spread it thick on one side of the bread. If you have vegan parmesan, dust it over the paste now.\</li>
<li>Place bread on baking sheet, paste up, for about 12-15 minutes.\</li>
<li>Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
