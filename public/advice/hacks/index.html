  <p>When I say I&rsquo;m hacking something together, that&rsquo;s a very specific statement.</p>
<p>To create something on something else, to patch together a solution from disparate pieces onto an existing workflow, that&rsquo;s something I do all the time in computer science, and every time I do it, I later regret it. I&rsquo;m not gonna stop, because it&rsquo;s often the most efficient way for me to learn&ndash;for example, I learned to write Nix by editing .nix files with no fucking clue what I was doing and then parsing the error messages&ndash;but it is bad practices.</p>
<p>Every time I hack something together, it makes the later issues worse. When my clock script broke my notification daemon, I had to spend hours troubleshooting, because it wasn&rsquo;t a solution from scratch&ndash;it was just a bunch of piecemeal lines I&rsquo;d grabbed from other projects. If I&rsquo;d just made it from scratch, and it broke, the troubleshooting would have been <em>easier,</em> because the structure would have been Its.</p>
<p>Every time you hack, whether it&rsquo;s a fix in your head or a fix in your computer, you are taking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parlay">parlay</a> that says:</p>
<p>&ndash; This won&rsquo;t break anything else.<br>
&ndash; The dependencies here will cause no harm OR go away on their own.<br>
&ndash; This will be good enough to be a permanent solution if I never get around to it properly.<br>
&ndash; This will do what I want it to do, and nothing else.</p>
<p>There is a reason you <em>do not take parlays in gambling.</em> The payout might be great, but it&rsquo;s irrelevant, because the odds are <em>long</em> at <em>best.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hack myself or my cognitive processes, ever. It&rsquo;s not worth the risk-reward. I engineer solutions instead; the goal of engineering yourself is to have a full and functional system that you can be happy with, not one that&rsquo;s <em>good enough.</em></p>
<p>When I see a system I want in myself, I build it off my core, every time. Sometimes, it requires other parts of my <a href="/glossary#cognition">cognitive firmware</a>, and when it does, I make sure I am happy with <em>every single piece I&rsquo;m building it reliant on.</em> I have a full and functional system that I&rsquo;m happy with, because everything I rely on to function is built off my core, my first principles, directly and tabs only other systems built direct off my core to work.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there are things I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like in my me. I generally call this &ldquo;legacy code&rdquo;. The solution to legacy code is, invariably, to remove it entirely.</p>
<p>This is something I can only do because I have built a full and functional system off my core.</p>
<p>Legacy code still affects my <a href="/glossary#self">mim</a>, but when I notice it, I can remove it safely, because the only things hanging on it are more legacy code. I don&rsquo;t need to worry about &ldquo;I need this to cope&rdquo;, because if I do need it to cope and it&rsquo;s legacy code, tough shit, Morgan, it&rsquo;s time to sit down and reason out a replacement <em>within my system.</em></p>
<p>So: how do you do this?</p>
<p>The selves that people build by default tend to be haphazard things of ingrained response and unexposed incentive. In early 2024, we experienced what we&rsquo;ll call ego suicide. It took us about a year and change to build a self from there. This is because if you just kind of destroy your <a href="/glossary#self">You</a>, you still have that ingrained response and unexposed incentive going through. We functioned on&hellip;mostly reflex, with a couple false starts&ndash;selves we didn&rsquo;t end up liking&ndash;until we hit on re/constructing from first principles. From there, we were able to build internal machinery to create things that allowed us to tear out the legacy code that had covered similar functions&ndash;for example, the legacy code of &ldquo;never kill yourself, because of spite&rdquo;, &ldquo;treat yourself, because you deserve hedonism&rdquo;, and &ldquo;you gotta expect more from others towards you&rdquo; is now covered by &ldquo;nothing is exempt from receiving kindness&rdquo;, off our first principle.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not going to do ego death, you start where we did&ndash;write a first principle. Choose something that all else can stem from. Identify what you need, and rather than copying it over or hacking together something with it, build something <em>new.</em> Destroy the dependency dependency in your head&ndash;don&rsquo;t let yourself build vast nets of firmware interreliance where one bad piece sours the pot.</p>
<p>Stop hacking yourself and start actually building something new.</p>
