  <p>&lsquo;Sorry&rsquo; is all well and good, but what are you going to <em>do</em> about it?<br>
Let me explain. There are three kinds of apologies.</p>
<p>One: the <em>superficial apology</em>. &ldquo;Oop, sorry&rdquo; is the most benign form of this, running into someone and apologising and moving on is, like, just a generally nice thing to do. However, a lot of people extrapolate this into a counterproductive form.<br>
Generally, apologising for something that doesn&rsquo;t matter just obligates the other conversational participants to comfort you. The more self-flagellating the apology, the worse this is, because it carries over into the way I approach other apologies from you in future. If you do something that&rsquo;s, for lack of a better phrase, kinda sucks, I&rsquo;ll point it out to you if I trust you not to self-flagellate about it and just to use the data. If you&rsquo;ve done something that hurts or irritates me, the last thing I&rsquo;m going to want is to have to comfort you out of a spiral. I&rsquo;ll do it, because as a general rule I think that not doing it would be incompatible with who I want to be, but I will not be bringing data to you in future.</p>
<p>Two: the <em>spiraling apology</em>. This is a specific kind of apology that is entirely self-flagellation. The focus in this kind of apology isn&rsquo;t on the action, but <em>you.</em><br>
If you hurt me by saying something inaccurate about me, like fuckin calling me a person, I don&rsquo;t want you to spiral about it, I want you to incorporate that data and do better. If you are spiraling, you aren&rsquo;t actually incorporating the data, you&rsquo;re 5&amp;10ing yourself into the world where any harm you ever do to someone else is a Mortal Sin and an Indicator of Evil. Where the superficial apology is counterproductive because it exhausts other conversationalists, the spiraling apology is counterproductive because you are not incorporating &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re incorporating &ldquo;I Guess I&rsquo;m Just A Horrible Person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Third, and finally: the <em>productive apology.</em> This is the only kind of apology I want to see.<br>
In the productive apology, you are presented with data, either from someone else or your own recognition skills, and you make a commitment to a plan of action to not make that mistake again. That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s the entirety of it! The folk you hurt are not obligated to comfort you, and they receive knowledge that they don&rsquo;t have to fear it happening again! There&rsquo;s only a problem if you don&rsquo;t stick to that commitment!</p>
<p>Now, one and two don&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. They&rsquo;re taught by the idea that apologising is safer than taking up space, that blaming yourself in advance is the only way to evade worse harm. This is, generally, an effective survival instinct if you&rsquo;re in an abusive situation, this is why it happens. What irks me is when they happen around me, because frankly if you think you need to <em>survive my wrath</em> over something, either you&rsquo;ve done something genuinely horrific enough to tick me all the way off&ndash;which is <em>damn</em> difficult to do, even harder if you&rsquo;re trying to be better&ndash;or your model of me is poor-at-best.</p>
<p>I suppose what I&rsquo;m trying to say is: stop treating your friends like they will be as bad as your abusers. If they really will be, you should be kind to yourself by leaving the situation and not taking that shit. If they won&rsquo;t be&ndash;spoiler, most of the time this is the case&ndash;then stop being unkind to not only yourself, but to them by assuming the worst. If you do something wrong, and you don&rsquo;t know how to address it, you can <em>ask!</em> You don&rsquo;t have to make a plan of action alone&ndash;just don&rsquo;t make others feel Obligated to teach you how not to hurt them.</p>
<p>Put a lot less pressure on yourself to be perfect, and learn to act on data, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself improving before you even know it.</p>
